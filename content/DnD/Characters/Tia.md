## Backstory

Tia comes from an ancient clan of assasins from a small village in a hidden valley. Locally the clan is well liked and Tia is considered something of a local folk hero and is a rising star within his clan. The clan itself is a bit odd compared to other assasin groups. They have a strong sense of honor and most often will chose to do what they believe they should do "damn the consequences". This has lead to a cyclical rise and fall in the clans numbers. Although they don't broadcast their intentions, they don't try to actively hide the fact that they have, since the begining of their foundation, been searching for a specific "god" they have vowed to find and kill. This god is fairly secretive and little is known of them other then their name "Skadi"
