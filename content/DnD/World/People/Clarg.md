# Notes
Boss of the goblins. We found him in a cave after being ambushed by some goblins. He had a pet wolf and we ended up defeating him and his group. After the defeat Tia offered to give him a clean kill if he would provide us with information. He agreed but said that all he could give us was a name. [[DnD/World/Places/Cragma]]. We assume it's a place but aren't for sure. It could also be a person.
