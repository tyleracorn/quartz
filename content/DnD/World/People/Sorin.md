# Notes

Barkeep, owner, and brewer of the lone inn on bloody beach. He is a friendly person, who we took a liking to. He gave us some supplies, some liquor, and provided Tia with some brewing supplies. He mentioned that we could potentially find some work with his cousin [[DnD/World/People/Gundrin]].
