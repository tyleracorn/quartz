title: "The Sword Coast North"
---

The Sword Coast North is comprised a rough landscape of rugged hills, precarious mountain ranges and dense forests, it was home to several like-minded towns and cities. The most prominent of these cities banded together with nearby allies to form the [[World/Groups/Lords_Alliance]] which united much of the region. On the south end of the coast is [[DnD/World/Places/balders_gate]] which is haven for smuggling and character's of questionable character. On the north end of the coast is Neverwinter which we aren't supposed to try to go to.
