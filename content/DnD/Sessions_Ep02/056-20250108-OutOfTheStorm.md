## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- After floating for a while. We decide to put the body of #razortooth_mike  in the book.
- The rest of us decide to also get in the book while Aeyr turns into a dolphin and tries to carry the book as far south with the currant as she can.
	- Aeyr eventually finds an island and gets to shore then opens it so we can leave
- Fiona casts tiny hut and most of us except for #sashenstar take a #long_rest in the hut
	- The hawk is patroling around during the night and notices a skiff with some huminoids sailing towards the island from the direction we came from
	- the hawk shits on #sashenstar and their familiar
- Puss tries to revive #razortooth_mike but he read the spell wrong and it only works if the person had died within the last minute. However he thinks he just said the spell wrong
- The hawk sees that the boat has anchored on the other side of the bay and the people are searching the forest near them.
	- The hawk flys closer but it can't really discern any known markings. They are heavily armed and are systematically searching up and down the trea line for something.
