## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

Sashenstar and Arey start approaching the creature even though it appears to be asleep
- The creature wakes up, then runs towards us but when it only get's partway it appears to hit a barrier or something, there is loud bang, and it get's thrown back
- Sashenstar runs towards the creature asking if it's ok
- I look around and I notice that there is a weird imprint in the trees/grass behind it.
	- I work my way around towards the imprint
	- I see a large cylindrical object that is making an imprint in the forest... but I don't see anything. It looks like it's snaking it's way into the other part of the forest
- When others do an arcana check they can't see anything physical but they can tell that there is something on it that is restraining it
- When we get somewhat close. The creature makes a motion and then limbs come out of the ground and form a table near us with tea cups on it
	- When it performs this magic, we can smell some searing and aery can see some sort of searing chain around it.
- sashenstar drinks the tea
	- they have a calm relaxed feeling after drinking it
- I touch the creature and cast identify
	- It's the softest thing ever 
	- It looks at me with sad eyes like it assumes it is going to futile
	- the closest spell it seems like is planar binding. However it feels more ancient
		- a celestial being is bound to an area against it's will
		- It feels like the spell comes off it and trails behind it into the forest
	- I give it a hug and it looks super happy and then it pulls me into a deep beer hug
	- After it releases me I start to weep but I feel very happy from the hug
- Aeyr hugs the creature and also starts weeping
- after drinking the tea we get 20 temp hit points
- When we are all sitting in front of it something happens and it's like we are all linked to it's mind. It shows us vision
	- It's the same spot where we are in and a distorted figure appears. the creature offers it tea but the figure swipes the tea to the ground and starts casting the planar binding spell.
	- We see the chain binding the creature goes down into a deep pit in another part of the island
	- we see some spirit sprites come trying to free it but when they touch the chain they turn to ash
	- The figure is trying to ask the creature questions about something that you can't hear but then eventually leaves disgruntled as if it didn't find out what it wanted
	- As the figure leaves it casts magic missiles at any sprites it sees
- Afterwards we feel mentally fatigued almost like we have been awake 24hr
