## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log
- We decide to head due west for a while. #razortooth_mike needs some help sailing. He needs a spotter, and some other hands
	- we grab some oars and pull out of the bay
	- we start sailing to the west
	- We catch some fish
	- during the night, I think I spy maybe some boats trailing us. I mention it to razortooth mike
	- razortoon thinks it's a little odd based on the direction they are coming from doesn't quite make sense but that the way they are sailing suggests raiders.
	- We try to get lose them but it doesn't work. They approach and it looks like we will have to fight them
		- two boats, each boat can have up to 30 people
