## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

Puss decides to use "talk to the dead" spell and asks the following questions
	- who is chald
		- our master
	- Why are you on this island
		- looking for you
	- why were you looking for us?
		- we needed to bring you back to where your from
	- for what perpose
		- to have you serve Chald
	- Where can we find Chald
		- the place where the storms are
- He feels a buzz during the spell 
	- puss has felt this before. He's felt it for a while now
	- He's not affected by it. But he feels an irritation towards him
-  Fiona does an arcana check on the orb
	- his two orbs are different.
		- The old orb was used or could be used to cast a crazy spell but burned up the person
		- The new orb he feels that the essence of a soul was put into the orb. This one has the soul of a deity inside of it.
- The wood sprites are chirping at as. Some back towards where we came from started hiding. Some in front of us start trying to pull us along the path we were heading. It seems like they are trying to warn us that something is hiding
- Aery, Puss, and Sashenstar follow the sprites
- Fiona and I hide to see what's following us
	- The forest goes quiet and it feels like what happened before
	- We relay that to the others they encourage us to catch up
	- We start trying to catch up.
- We travel for an hour or so and eventualy we come to a sheer rock face
- At some point I can hear some voices behind us that sound angry
- Aeyr picks up that the forest sprites are debating about what to do. some of them are concerned that what they might decide would endangers either others or us
- when I try to fade into the forest to keep an eye out for the group.. they start getting worried and one starts trying to bite my heels and keep me around
	- the one biting my heels starts trying to get my attention towards a path towards the left
- We follow the sprites then eventually reach a waterfall and the sprites head towareds the waterfall
	- the sprites seem worried and cautious
	- When they see us all are present. They start humming and then the waterfall opens up and there is a tunnel into the rockface. They enter and one waits for us
- We all head in.
