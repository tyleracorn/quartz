## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log
- I head back towards the dragon to see what's going on there
	- I hear what sounds like someone exvating rock
	- I sneak closer, and I see the dragon digging away at the rock following the path we went
	- It's about half a km down the tunnel. I estimate it's going to take about 50 hours
- A Fire Spell hits us and some arrows come raining down
- About 40 feet out in the water a ship comes around the bend with the drow and 3 pirate looking people
- I shoot at the drow then go back into the tunnel 15 ft
- When I come back out the drow is missing, but the pirates are prone in the boat. we end up killing the three pirates
- the drow ends up behind us in the cave and casts cloudkill hitting those closest to them
- Fiona disintegrates the drow
- All that is left is another one of the orbs and a ring with stone in it 
	- the ring is a "ring of alarm" that an alarm will send based on up to 3 conditions for a large alarm will sound
- The boat sinks because too much damage was done to it
- We see vines growing down the cliff above us. They are growing pretty quickly so we decide to wait an hour and they grow down to us. 
	- A basket forms in the vines. 
	- We get in the basket.
	- On the horizon we can barely see what we think might be something like fireworks
- We go up and meet totorro. lots of hugs. They give us food and tea which give us a health boost
- #totorro_flask He pulls out from his fur a flask for each of us with some of the tea that if we take its like taking a long rest and +20 bonus health
- He also gives us each a #totorro_cloak which is made from the softest vines and flower. It gives advantage on hiding and if you sniff the inside of it once a day you can gain advantage on one roll.
- He also hands over to one of a #totorro_teapot . It starts raining. He produces an umbrella and then he motions us to follow him
- We follow him in a basket. And he takes us down to the beach. He then points at aery and motions at the teapot and motions that she should blow in it. 
	- The teapot makes some nice music noise and the storm in that spot stops and it's now calm and peacefull in that area.
	- He then puts the umbrella upside down in the water and its now something like a boat for us
- We now have a #totorro_umbrealla that works like a boat
- Once we are in the umbrella he pushes out a breath and we get pushed out to sea and end up in the perfect ocean stream to leave the island.
