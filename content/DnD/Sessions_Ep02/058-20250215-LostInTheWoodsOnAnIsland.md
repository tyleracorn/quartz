## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- I am following sneakily along but not with the group... pretty much doing parrallel play
- I hear some twigs snapping coming from the direction we came from
	- I slow down and start paying attention to what might be coming up behind us
	- I start to see four of the crew searching the beach following the groups path. They are progressing slowing but surely
- We decide to prepare to meet the people coming up behind us. We setup an ambush in case they.
	- We setup an x in the dirt, an illusion of blood with a trail going into the blood and a rock with light cast on it
- I see them as they are passing me by. 2 of them are normal pirate looking people with axe throwers. One has a weird looking ball and chain weapon. The 4th is a drow with a bow and is in the back
	- It looks like the drow is the leader
- They stop just past me (10ft or so) but still about 20 ft from the others
	- They start complaning about how annoying it is what they are doing
	- the drow says what Chaal wants Chaal gets
- They continue on and then stop when they see the x and stuff. They are confused and they start investigating it.
- I cast message to the drow asking why they are following us
	- the drow is surprised jumps and yells show yourself
	- one of the axe throwers turns and throws it's axe at some movement and hits and kills one of the forest sprites
- We roll initiative and attack since they killed the forest sprite
- They are all restrained by Aery's web and my syckal attack blinds them all for 3 turns
	- We hit them a bunch
	- Axe 1 is killed. 
	- I put drow and axe 2 to sleep
	- The other's end up killing them dispite me trying to put them to sleep to question them
	- I end up killing the chain man
- we loot and find
	- 26 gold
	- a hand axe attached to a cable that can be attached to a hand
	- 32 gold, and a signet ring
	- 82 gold, fancy drow bow and dagger, flask of oil, and a glass orb with opaque smoke (this is the same type of orb as what the skeletons where holding way back in the beginning)
	- 16 gold, iron ingot
- puss revives the forest sprite
- I drag the bodies into the forest and offer them to the forest
-
