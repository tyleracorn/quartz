## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- We are behind th waterfall. There is a passage that we are now in that is dark but weirdly quiet almost like a muffled bubble around us.
- Fiona sees some inscription along the walls
	- Beneath the boughs where shadows dance,
	  Through ancient roots and whispered glance,
	  By leaf and root by stone and stream
	  I Call to thee O spirit dream
	  
	  With breath of moss and heartbeat of the earth
	  I weave this path reborn in the earth's own mirth
	  Let light bend, let shadows stretch
	  A journey carved, from stone to flesh
- At the end of the passage are some stairs/incline that start winding upwards
- Fiona sees more inscriptions
	- From the core of the soil and stone,
	  I Channel roots the seeds unknown
	  Let the rocks yield the earth obey
	  Carve this path where I will stay
	  
	  Whispers of the woods the ancient trees
	  Guide the hand the winds the seas
	  A winding tunnel deep and true
	  The forest path Now born anew
	  
	- Walk no without respect or haste
	  For here the balance is no waste
	  The sacred grove where shadows play
	  Is not for those who come astray
	  
	  bound by light and ancient roots
	  The land the ski the earth salutes
	  Step lightly o seeker and you may see
	  The hidden truths that set you free
	  
	- The sky above the earth below
	  The hidden paths that gently flow
	  Come forth O wanderer if you dare
	  To seek the god who lingers there
		
- After a couple of hours it eventualy comes to an archway
- Sashenstar tries to run through and bounces off of an invisible force field
- The ghiblis are in a circle and the 2 that are unsure of us seem to be arguing with the 3 that like us
- Based on the inscriptions I invenstigate the lights and shadows for a hidden feature
	- I don't find anything
- Eventually the five come to an agreemant then they go up to the field, humm like they did to open the waterfall and now the field goes away and we can enter
	- We are on top of the mountain and can see everything around the island like the boat and where we were at
	- On the far size is a thicket of trees
- Aeryr heads to the trees and she can tell that they trees are magical and there are plenty of acorns and willows and she can hear something that sounds like it's snoring from somewhere in the trees
- -The five ghibli spirits head towards the trees
- Puss investigates and gets similir ish feelings as felicity but all negative instead of the happy vibes he had from Felicity
- Fiona decides to cast tiny hut and we take a #long_rest 
- We notice a lantern on the boat in the bay during the night
- After our rest we enter the woods. We try to do it stealthily. We enter a clearing and we see a shape in front of us by about 30 meters. It almost looks like a large ghibli
- we see a bunch of spirits sleeping around the figure
