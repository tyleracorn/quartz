## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

We contact Ilk to see if any of his Kin having sailing experience

I slip some mushroom phsychadelic mushrooms to the chef

- I'm fucked up from the mushrooms. I go outside and am entranced by the coming storm. I see what I think are spirits to the west that might lead us to sorin
	- The marsh called the merr of the dead is to south but I am convinced that we now need to go to the west.
- Fiona sees an aperation of Marys that rushes him. He senses the magic is leaking from the etherial plane around us
	- Fiona looks into the etherial plane. He sees Marys holding her severred head. He holds up her severred head that he kept and it becomes apparent it's cursed
	- puss removes the curse on the head (he's now a claric)
