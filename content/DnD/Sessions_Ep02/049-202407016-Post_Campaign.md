## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- After a long rest we come down and find #Cyrus who was the assistant of Mary's
	- He want's to talk to us about some important business and has some breakfast ready for us
	- We say if he can help us get the dead transfered to us from the KoV bar we'll hire him
- We then head back to the island to see if we can pick up Sorin Winterhill as a brewer for our new Inn
- The beach/island looks a little worse for wear. We come to the "bloody beach" and we see bodies in the water and on the beach and door busted in at the "bloody beach" inn.
	- Leading up to the tavern we see 12 bodies, some cut some have their necks broken
	- some of the "pirates" have a small crimson band on their wrist
		- They all have the same fish on it
- I head into the tavern and find 6 more bodies. All killed by a bladed weapon. None of them are dwarfs
	- Most of the up front alcohol has been looted and destroyed
	- We head to his secret room but it doesn't look it has been entered
	- Aeyr has a means to try to contact him with a pine cone. 
	- We find a severed hand holding the other pine cone. 
- As we are searching a figure enters the bar. (Aeron's new character)
