## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- Ther are 8 huminoud pirates and 4 drow that are systematically searching the shore on the oposite side of the bay from us.
- #sashenstar mentions to #Aery that they fealt tha weird vibe from the forest. Aery goes to check it out and gets the same feeling as from the forest where we met #Felicity. Aery determines that the forest is alive but they don't get the hostile feeling that she got from the previous forest.
	- #sashenstar and #Aery go look a little closer. Sashenstar sees a little white firball step out of the forest and looks at you then goes back into the forest.
- the pirates have left their boat anchored about 15m from their shore. we are looking at how we could steal the boat.
- They head into the woods looking for the white furball
	- I follow behind silently and in stealth
	- eventually I catch a glimpse of the white furball
	- everyone else eventually catches site and we realize these are the smallest form of forest sprites and they usually occupy a fey forest god.
	- We start heading towards the center of the island
