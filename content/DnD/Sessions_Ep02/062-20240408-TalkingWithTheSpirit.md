## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

Sashenstar sends their familiar down hole to check it out. The familiar can hear the oceac clear when it starts going down the hole.
- We climb into the book then Aeyr turns into a spyder, takes the book and goes down the hole
- When she get's close to the bottom she can hear the ocean
- I pocket #razortooth_mike ring with his family crest on it and Puss starts doing the rights over him

We make it the bottom of the hole
- we find an alter with 4 pillars around it that are about 3 feet tall
	- on top of each pillar is an orb
	- each orb is half-way burried in the pillar
- at the end of the hole she can see the ocean
- against one side closer to the end aeyr sees a metal outline of a dragon that is the same makeup as the machine under phandalain but it lmolded into the rock.
	- it's about 60 ft down the wall
- #bartholomew goes up and pokes at the metal outline
	- it reacts and he takes some psychic damage
	- There is then a mechanical click and now there is a ticking sound inside the cavern
- Aeyr grabs bartholomew and then quickly lets us out of the book. So when we come out we can hear the ticking.
	- sashenstar then goes and pokes the metal outline
		- then takes psychic damage
	- The ticking then grows louder and one of it's eyes starts glowing
- fiona reads the pillars
	- it's an invisible trickster that borrows the shape of anything it touches
	- it dances not for us but for the unseen forces that wove the stars
	- the ghosts that moves without form yet sculpts the world
	- patient and ancient Forged from stellar bones and planetery collisions, it cradles all that grows.
- I make the assumption that this altar has something to do with the chain
	- I do an arcana check and I can kind of see some magic impressions that it looks like the chain breaks off into 4 sections connecting to each pillar
- a second eye lights up on the dragon
- We think the pillars are related to magic elements and we think
	- pillar 1 - water
	- pillar 2 - fire
	- pillar 3 - air
	- pillar 4 - earth
- We try to figure out the riddle
	- Fiona casts firebolt at the second pillar and it lights up.
	- I blow some air on the 3rd pillar and it lights up
	- aeyr throws a stone at pillar 4 and it lights up
	- aeyr spits on the 4th pillar and it lights up
	- puss stands on the alter and makes a prayer to his god about love and that does it and the chains disapear 
- The dragon is still ticking and lighting up more. So we start booking it.
	- We are a ways away when we hear a mechanical shriek coming from behind us and have to make a dex saving throw as a fireball comes roaring down the tunnel
	- we hear large bellows from the dragon and the ticking start back up again
	- We reach the rocky shores of the ocean after exiting the cave
