## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

We fought the mother grub. She couldn't quite reach us do to narrow spots in the cave. We hurt her enough that she ran off. Our only option at this point is to continue forward or head back to the lake.

## Log

* I look up in the ceiling, I see where the worm ran off, but I can't see it or hear anything
* Aeyis explanes what it was. a carion crawler
	* They produce venom through their tentacles and when they latch on they inject
	* They tend to live alone
	* They sometimes eat their own offspring
* We come across 13 dead bodies of miners
* 1 miner is still alive his name is gavin
	* He was attacked by goblins 
	* They set up the cave-in 
	* They had a backup escape setup
	* When he realizes that he is pretty bad shape, he gives us a simple ring with a stone set in it and ask to give it to his sister
* We continue on but with the idea that the lake is a backup escape
* We come upon a deadend with a huge pit
	* Aerys turns into a bat and flies down to check it out
	* its deep (hundrends of meters)
	* There are some random fresh (within the last few days) bodies at the bottom 
	* The path does continue on
		* She hads further down the path and finds some bodies that are all goblins
* We had back to the lake
* When we get near the cave in we can hear something large moving around on the other side of the cavein
* We take a long rest at the lake
	* Again we have the same horrible nightmare
	* This time however, the nightmares affect us so much that we only get half the health and speel slots back that we should have
