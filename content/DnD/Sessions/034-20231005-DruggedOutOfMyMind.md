## Session Summary

We all get drugged then make friends with Felicity as well as rock gnome and their goat friend/companion. After chatting and starting to get to know Felicity we are interrupted by a group that are looking for Felicity. I hide before they show up since we aren't sure who it might be. He seems like a nice enough fellow and this new group we aren't really sure about. So like usually it looks like we'll be getting into a fight with them. 
## Recap of Last Session

## Log

Every one else ends up taking the food, and we are all drugged.
Nothing is wrong, but everything around us is vibrant. The quiet forest has come to life. The goat and gnome are awake, and you are able to talk to them. Anyone that didn't eat seems blurry
- Felicity is happy and says "see this is a safe space, eat and be happy".
- Fiona asks Felicity has heard about the blackspyder
	- He says he's heard the name but can't remember anything else. Then starts talking about some problem with the giants.
- Felicity introduces us to the rock gnome and the goat
- Mer is the goat and Harkess is the rock gnome
- Fiona says the safe word and is booted out of the group
- I talk to Felicity and convince him to help bring this safe/drugged space to others like the black spyder. He then gives us a bag and says this should give you enough for 10 trips
	- we open the bag, and it's filled with dead leaves from the forest
	- he warns to not take them out within the forest. It's not totally legit.  But it was already dead, so it's sort of ok by the tree's own rules
- Fiona gets the feeling that we are being watched and noticed that felicity also seems to sense it
- Aeyr says the safe word, and we are all booted. We all feel fully rested and feel so rejuvinated that get advantage on our next roll.
- Felicity talks about some danger... but then is staring off to the left and then says something about he doesn't feel like we are alone anymore and that he has a feeling we'll be interrupted soon.
- He warns us that there are others like him that treat people like us badly
- we hear some noise. We get ready
- I hide near the side of the woods where the noise is coming from and I am super well hidden
- 4 shapes step out
	- 1 Drows
	- 2 kobolds (1 red, 1 blue)
	- 1 Tiefling
- They in a blue and black color scheme that is coordinated, and it seems familiar
- The drow says "I told you we would find it.. Stop damaging the trees! And stares at the Tiefling"
- Harkness address the group... their eventual response is "if you know what's good for you, you'll get away from that worm (Felicity).
- The drow whistles.. And from the opposite side of the clearing 6 more figures come out
	- 2 goblins
	- 1 orc
	- 3 drow
- The Main drow says enough talk and draws her bow. Her arrows don't look like standard arrows
	- they are long, black, and have corkscrew tipped arrows dripping
- I coat my dagger and shortsword with poison
- Fiona holds his action ready to toss firebolt if attacks happen
