## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

After finding our gear, we can't help but head back and check out the hidden passage. We eventually find a room that looks like the #black_spyder main office and sleeping area. We steal some stuff and find some information on what might be happening. As we are leaving however, we are attacked by #mavehous . She sounds the alarm and starts running. We are battling/chasing after her. We are trying to take her out and then go back for Farquad.

## Log

#mavehous turns to me and say that "clan" recognizes "clan" and that she recognizes my fighting style and that she can smell balders gate on puss' fur. She says dying wouldn't be a service to her mistress and says something about running. Then disappears in a shower of silver. 

- #puss starts running towards the entrance to look for farquad
	- I follow and start readying some caltrops with poison
	- I sneak up can to see 6 guards at the entrance. They sound scared saying they aren't ready to hold of an invasion.
	- We are all still pretty beat up so decide we can't attack and will have to escape and find farquad later
- We head back to the hidden exit that smells dank and super old. When we come to some stairs heading down
- We head down the stairs, and it takes quite awhile. It looks all dwarven and all immaculate. Smells of despair, though.
- We get to the ground floor and enter a square room with dwarven statues on the wall. There is one hallway, we walk down it. See one door on the side which we can't open. I decide not to use the skeleton key
- At the end of the hall are two offshoots, stairs that head up and to the left and one that heads down and to the right. The moss points to the right and down
- We continue to follow the moss. But at one point smell what smells like metal, but points away from the moss. We follow the smell and find a forge
	- The forge is cold, hasn't been operated for a while.
	- There are some ingots of silver and a metal we don't really recognize that's really lite weight.
		- We take 10 silver ingots
		- We take 6 special metal ingots
- We head back to where the moss was pointing
	- come to some ornate doors that the moss is pointing to along with some small doors to the side of the ornate door that are locked.
	- We use the skeleton key to unlock the door. It works, but the key looks flimsier and a slightly damaged
		- it goes down some more halls. It eventually enters a throne room with a dwarven skeleton in ornate armor holding an ornate hammer, with 3 arrows sticking out of the skeleton.
		- We investigate, and it looks like the throne has similar seams. 
			- I find two compartments on the throne that look like they might be key holes.
			- we decide to not use they skeleton key again unless we have to
	- We go back to the ornate doors. There are 3 holes and some runes. Fiona casts comprehend languages
		- The runes say  "Thomumlir Mountainspine grants you safe journey."
	- We stick 3 hands in and find something and twist. Our hands are locked in place. The outline of the king and his hammer is eliminated his name flashes 3 times.
