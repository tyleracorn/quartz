## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log
- someone comes in suprising us. We attack them out of surpise. 
- after talking to them they say they are here for the chef position. we do notice a general "help wanted" add on the wall.
- They tried making an artichoke dip but it wasn't really that good. They eventually notice that the room is a battle scene
- we investigate
	- it happened about a week ago
	- there were roughly 25 assailants and there are 12 bodies
	- we determine that the hand we found is #sorin hand
	- most of the bodies are wearing sailor type clothing
	- looks like most of the assailants probably had injuries of some kind
	- we determine that #sorin was dragged out of the inn.
	- I also find a wall safe that 16 different flasks in it and some roll up parchments with different recipes for brewing
		- each flask smells different but they are all whiskey
- we find a secret passage that heads to a private dock on the sea
	- there is a sail boat at the dock but it doens't look like it's ever been in the water though it has been taken care off
- Sorin was dragged to the southern part of the island. the secret dock is on the western part
- we see a storm on the horizon and we remember a marsh called the merr of the dead
- we clean up the bodies
