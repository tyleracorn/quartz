## Session Summary

I engage in a verbal battle with the goblins, trying to convince them it's too easy of a fight. However, #Gundrin implores me player to kill him. During the battle, #Gundrin slips a map of mine locations and a rare skeleton key into my armor as I kill him. We are subsequently taken to a pen within the goblin camp, where we meet Ilk. Fiona seeks Ilk's help to remove our shackles and collars. We negotiate with the captured goblin chiefs, proposing to help free the goblins in exchange for their assistance. The goblins hatch a plan to help us leave the camp in a cart, but we realize it won't work for me who is too large.

## Recap of Last Session

We were caught and then I was thrown into a fighting pit with #Gundrin that is a fight to the death
## Log

* I spend a while trying to taunt and convince the goblins that this is a week fight. Gundrin finally convinces me that he wants me to kill him so I eventually attack.
- While fighting #Gundrin he slips something under my armour
- I end up killing #Gundrin 
- Shakles are put on me as I come out the pit
- We are taken off to a pen in a camp. The pen is filled with some goblins.
- Ilk is in the pen
	- Fiona askes him if anyone in the group can help us get the shakles and collars off
	- Ilk runs to some goblins that look like they are elders chats with them and brings us a lock pick
	- We pick our locks
- Fiona talks with the chiefs and asks if there is any way they could help us escape and that we would help set them free if we can if we can escape
- One side of the pen is near an open forest. The other side of the pen is near the gate and the camp. about 30ft beyond the camp is more forest
- There are 18 guards. 4 at each corner, 8 are guarding the gate. The rest are walking
	- We can't quite make out what the characters are on the parapet of cragmaw.
- I look at what gundrin slipped which turns out to be some pieces of paper
	- 1 that is a map that looks like mine locations 
	- 1 is a note in dwarvish
	- 1 is another note in dwarvish with a homemade key
		- I recognize that it is a very rare form of a skeleton key
- They come up with a plan to hide some of us in a cart leaving the camp. this wouldn't work with for me since I'm too large
