* We are working our way through the water passage in the cave

* We start hearing slow clapping and we see Marys standing near us. She starts a fire 15 feet away from us
* There is a pot of stew on the fire that she offers to us
* She informs us that there have been 2 other attacks. She's going to take the left over people she has to go investigate one of the attack locations, and she says we should go investigate the other.
* We take a long rest. In the morning we see we are in a valley. The cave was east of the town. We don't really know where we are at. We start hiking up to some high ground and see some chimney smoke that looks like it's probably Phandalin
* We hike aways, go to stop, there isn't really a spot to stop, and then hike into the woods a little then take another long rest.
