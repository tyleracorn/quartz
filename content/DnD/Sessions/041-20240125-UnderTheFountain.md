## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

We realize that Puss is no longer with us. We eventually find him back at the well where he went and explored down it. He found a passageway with some guards down a passageway. We head down the well. There's a large pool of water at the bottom with a ledge and tunnel on one end. We make it to the Ledge after multiple of us nearly drown.
## Log

- We see two goblins who are surprised by what they just saw. We see an alarm bell past them
	- We surprise enough that we end up bluffing our way past the goblins.
	- There is a door that we proceed through
- We see an image of the dwarves constructed a weapon like this below to beat the dragons
	- ![[notes/images/Pasted image 20240125202923.png]]
- We find some machinery. We get it working. It makes a lot of noise. Some guards start coming
- 8 guards come walking in. They are dressed a little like the patrons of the giants toe when we first met #Marys but they now have chain mail armour on over their tunics
	- I recognize some of them from the bar
- We try to convince them we are fixing the machinery for Marys
	- all but one are convinced
	- We get some of them to start helping clear out the machinery
	- I show them my contract. 
	- We convince them to finish clearing out the rubble and say we'll report the results to #Marys 
	- One of the guards is convinced so well that he offers to get us a drink for the help. 
- We follow the guard for a drink. When we got the machinery running, it also turned on some lights
- We come to the bar. There are about 60 guards in the room.
- We grab a table and get a drink with the guard who is named Hemon Cenacchi
- We catch some chatter about the recent activities
	- They were part of the army that sacked kragma and the town
- There are 3 exits including the one we came in.
	- 1 looks like there's a spot for bedrolls
	- 1 is guarded by some drow
	-
