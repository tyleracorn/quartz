	* The miner's deep in the mine were attacked by goblins and the guild is wanting to blow the entrance and seal in the goblins. The Miner's are arguing, the guild doesn't want to wait.
* We walk up and ask what's going on. The guild rep makes a snyde remark about us being mary's slave and say's he'll blow the entrance with us in it
	* I pick up the bureaucrats and intimidate by picking him up by the shirt collar and ask who's calling us slave
