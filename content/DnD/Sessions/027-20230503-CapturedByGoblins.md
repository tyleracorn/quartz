## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

We decided to try to take a long rest. The goblins trick the person on watch and attack us, capturing us all.  In the process I get knocked out shot full of arrows. We are captured and magical handcuffs that cut us off from using any magic

## Log
* I come to after being partially healed by the goblins but with a bag over my head. 
* They stripped us of our posession but didn't remove any jewlery
* I start trying to pay as much attention as I can to where we being taken and what I can hear or smell around me. 
	* They take us out of the cave, taking us through the bush. Based on the sound and smell, it doesn't seem like we are with the main group of goblins. 
	* We can still hear the one hobglobin.
	* After about an hour we are hoisted up into what seems like a wagon. We can smell horses.
	* We aren't alone in the wagon.
* I remove my hood.
	* We are in an iron cage on top of a wagon along with 15 other miners. I hear some shouts and the wagon starts moving. 
	* There are 6 wagons with 1 driver and 1 guard, and hobglobin on a horse.
	* The miners don't have any handcuffs on. Their hands are free.
* We travel for a couple of hours
	* Meanwhile I try to get info from the miners what happened
		* They were all recently captured just hours before we showed up.
		* They were captured from Grand Venture mine (we were at the Eden Mine).
		* The grand venture mine is where Marys went to
		* I try to give the miners some hope and comfort. They start feeling better
	* We come up to a smoother more ancient seeming road.
* We come up to some structures
	* There are multiple fires with hundreds of goblins around them
	* There are a few towers but they are weathered and somewhat crumpled
	* There is a drawbridge but the moat is dry
	* After we enter the entrance is shut with an iron gate
	* We can also see some shadows up on the ramparts
* The wagon stops and they unload us
	* The miners are taken through one path of the fortress
	* The hob globin decides that he will escort us as a special prize for the boss
		* The goblins call hime #Argov
	* He leads us into the fortress and into a grand chamber
		* It's a square room by about 100 ft by 300 wide
		* There are stone statues (some of them have smashed) and they look dwarven made
		* At the far end is a thick ornate table with some weird magical lamps that are glowing
		* There are 4 different entrances, 2 off of each side.
		* Standing in front of the table is a person that is the spitting image of #Marys, and she is talking to a halfling.
			* The halfling walks away through one of the side doors
		* When the person turns we see that one side of the face is the spitting image of #Marys but the other half of the face is burned horribly
		* She gets mad that Ilk is with us saying "why is their kind here" and gets some guards to come and drag him away.
			* Aeyr trys to grab Ilk but she gets back handed
		* She says #mavehous fix this.
			* A tiefling seems to appear out of nowhere and magically stablizes Aery and then poors a healing potion down their throat
		* She Tells Argov. "No times for games. As long as her pieces off of the board. We only need 1 more gem, Either put them into the games or make them diggers it doesn't matter. We have 5 days before we hit the last site. It doesn't matter."
	* Argov leads us away. We eventually down some stairs into a dark, wet area. Argov is grumbling to himself and he sounds unsure of himself.
		- We eventually come to a room with rows and rows and rows of cells. All of them are empty except for one that has a lump in a corner we can't really see.
		- He puts us in the cell next to the one occupied and lines us up
			- The tiefling appears and puts a collar around our neck. After the collar is around our neck he removes the shackles
			- We still don't have access to magic
			- Across from us and down the room is a table with 3 other hobglobins
			- The Teifling smiles at us then dissapears 
		- It turns out the person in the cell next to us #Gundrin 
		- Farquad asks if he found the #forge_of_spells 
			- He gets too emotional and says that if it wasn't for his quest then #Zaron the drow witch, wouldn't have used his map to get so much power.
		- I ask gundrin about the collars around our neck. He says he doesn't know much about them but says they aren't dwarven but are ancient. 
		- I ask Gundrin about the teifline
			- He looks ashamed and  says he was approached by her in neverwinter and he let spill about his mission about the #forge_of_spells . 
		- Puss asks if he knows what's the pieces are that #Zaron is looking for
			- He doesn't think #forge_of_spells exhists. She's after something more sinister. She needs 5 gems to get it. Each gem is a dwarven key to a storage/treasure. 
		- Gundrin says if we could escape he could get to the gem first. But he doesn't think he can escape
		- I try to pick the lock but am unsuccesful 
	- Argov shows up in the morning. Says it's time for some fun. Puts shackles on #Gundrin and opens our cell, then leads us out. We can start hearing a lot of commotion. We are lead out into a courtyard with a 20 ft pit with crude stands set up around it.
	- Gundrin lowers himself down into the pit.
	- Argov selects me and pushes me into the pit.
