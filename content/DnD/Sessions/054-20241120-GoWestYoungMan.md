## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- one of the ships turns slightly towards us or maybe towards the storm
- the storm is directly west of us and heading towards us some.
- Aeyr turned into a dolphin and is checking out the boats. In the process she is conversing with some other dolpins to see if they can tell her anything about the boats
	- the dolphins say the boats came from the north where the water was colder
	- the boats keep dropping morsels that they eat and therefore they've been staying some with the boats
- Aery returns to the boat. Talks to #razortooth_mike about what she found out.
	- It's a little concerning that they are coming from their homeland
- The boat goes by. they think see something for a sec but they don't see us. At one point we see that their are slaves on board
- We let them go by then we start following them.
- The storm catches up to us. It's pretty rough and I jump in to help #razortooth_mike .
