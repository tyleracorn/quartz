## Recap of Last Session

We are able to get out of the collars suppressing our magic through Fiona seducing one of the goblin guards. The neutral goblins are un willing to escape with us, since they would rather not start a civil war among their fellows. We therefore sneak back into the keep and do  a quick search until we find our confiscated gear
