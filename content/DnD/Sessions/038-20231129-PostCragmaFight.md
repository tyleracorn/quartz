## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

After killing the ogre and goblin, we check out the bodies. We don't find anything.
I search around and find a crossbow painted blue
We take a long rest
- I take the potion of mind reading
	- We get flashes of a war machine
	- We see her being commanded by a fiery voice to find the #vonindod
	- we can't tell who is commanding her
	- I also see flashes of giants and dragons
	- Also get flashes of the dwarvish orbs and there is sense of triumph especially the last one which we found on her. 
	- There is an ancient way against giants and dragons
		- dragons have historically been the top of the food chain
		- giants wanted that
	- There was an epic war between them
	- The giants created the #vonindod to ravage the land. It got destroyed, but part of it was buried below the town of #Phandalin .
	- She was sent by someone to find the #vonindod
	- She is on the side of giants
	- the orbs open the chamber where the dwarfs kept the portion of the #vonindod that they had. And the last orb, which is the one we found, powers the portion of the #vonindod
	- I ask what happened to the other orbs
		- Our employer has the other 5
	- I ask if they are sisters
		- She says the drow families are complicated
	- Aery heals her some when she starts coughing up blood
		- she seems shocked and unsure
	- we get images of mary's group being the group that attacked her and stole the orbs
	- I ask if she wants revenge
		- there is fear but the fear is more that she's afraid of when her masters' find out that they failed.
	- #Marys is on the side of the dragons
	- I don't get any sense of deception from her
- I take Ilk and leave the room and #Aery follows me
- Fiona then kills #black_spyder after we leave the room
- We go look for some sign of #farquad all that we find is his bottle that held his hand sanitizer.
	- #Aery realizes that #farquad would still be alive based on what she knows about the spell they used for the sanitizer 
- We leave cragma and eventually find our way to the cave where we were captured
- As we approach #Phandalin we see black smoke on the horizon
	- We find bodies of miners that look pretty brutalized
	- we find some bodies of goblins, ogres, and bugbears mixed in
	- As well as some bodies from the #lords_alliance group
- The slums are burned down
- There's some damage to the miners guild building but it looks mainly untouched.
- We walk through town to #spelunkin 
	- It looks relatively untouched but we can tell some spells have happened around there
	- Doors is locked but no one answers
	- we try picking the lock and trip a trap knocking us off the porch
