## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

After having an amazing night on mushrooms I am convinced I know which direction to head to find sorren which is dead west.  In the meantime we determine Mary's head (which fiona was hanging onto) was cursed. Puss nonchalantly removed the curse since they are a cleric now.

## Log

A take another long rest while we wait for our sailor help to arrive. Meanwhile the chef, who I ask their name again and learn is #sashenstar , makes some more soup for dinner. I have some although some of the others are hesistant

It's getting late when we hear a knock at the door. Fiona knocks back on the door which confuses the person. Fiona then makes a knock knock joke. The person at the door is a pretty rough looking human male with a missing eye, and missing hand. 
- He introduces himself as #razortooth_mike and says he thinks we sent for him
- he comes in and has some of the soup. He seems friendly and warms up to us pretty quickly
- when he sees me he comes up and swears a blood oath to me sayeing I saved his family and friends. It turns out his family are miners and he accredits their saving to me
- I cut my own hand and grasp his cut hand with mine than tell him to just act normal around us
#razortooth_mike goes back to his soup than asks where are we sailing too. 
	- We ask if there is anything due west. He says nothing that he knows about due west. Some stuff southwest and some northwest.
	- we ask about the pirate colors and symbols on the pirates. Unfortunately he says the pirates change so much he doesn't recognize these particular ones and can't tell if they are just new pirates or old pirates that have changed.
	- I explain what we know about #sorin and my vision. He's not sure and doesn't have any specific suggestions for us, but he's willing to sail due west to the end of the world for us.
- Razortooth mike inspects the ship. Says we have about 5 days of rations and water which would get us just past #the_purple_rocks. 
	- I ask about the purple rocks. He said he would rather not utter anything and anger #umberly . He says they she has a lot of followers on the purple rocks. He would rather not sail there but if you ask I will. We just might not return from there.
		- I know that #umberly is the sea goddess. There is a lot of superstition about not uttering her name on the open seas.
	- I ask if the pirate banner from the dead priates could be related to this group
		- It's not uncommon for people like them to hire pirate groups for supplies or for other reasons.
- He gives us more info of the surrounding areas
	- #gunderlan is where is from and it's to the northwest. It's home to the best fisherman, boatmakers, sailors, They have lots of wharehouses and do lots of traiding. The capital city is #gundbarg . A lot of miners live there. He ended up with the #knights_of_the_void through that. He recommends going there doing some trading and getting a better vessel.
		- The farthest northwest island is #turen which is home to raders.
		- There is a myth of the #gunderlan island that there is a sunken ship with treasures from a mad wizards. It's pretty far under the seas the ship is called #golden_crown 
	- #the_purple_rocks is the home to the #craken cult. It's to the west. One of the islands is the ruins of #asguard which is an elven city that has been taken over by the cult. There is one island on the rocks you could make a break to if really need to. There #utherall but they will probably kill us and steal our goods or there us #guardsall on the other side and they will also kill us and steal our goods
		- There is a legend of the #flame_vault that was the home of three dragons which is supposed to be on one of the northern islans
	- 
- We talk to razortooth more, and he suggests starting by sailing west and then circle down to the southwest.
