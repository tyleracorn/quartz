	- multiple stab wounds
	- 35 gold
	- a plethora of daggers
- #black_spyder 
	- She is burned but still alive just unconscious
	- 3 soul orbs they are white and empty
	- In her hand we find a dwarvish orb
		- This is the type of orb that the #black_spyder was saying that they found 4 of the five.
	- We tie up the #black_spyder 
- Fiona examines the special orb and it's warm
- I hold the dwarvish orb and cast identify
- During long rest I hear some claining sound
	- It sounds like it's coming towards us and it sounds like some thing is striking the wall.
	- There is a very strong rank order coming down the passageway
- Out comes an ogre and a goblin which say "oh she said there would be leftovers!"
- A battle commences
	- we kill both the ogre and the goblin
