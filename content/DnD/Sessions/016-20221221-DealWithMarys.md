## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

We talk to Sildar and find out that the goblin problem is getting worse so he was heading out of town to try to get help from another Lords of Alliance outpost. We talk to him about Marys. We then talk to the wizards at the oddities shop and get their advice. We come to the conclusion that we either need to try to patch up our differences with Marys or decide she's evil and kill her.

We then spend the rest of the day getting outfitted for new clothing as we are expecting fall/winter to be approaching.

## Log

I pick up some honey and put it in my poison flask.
We sneak Marys back out of the city and find a clearing in the woods to talk to her. I investigate and make sure nobody is around us
* We take the hood and amulet off of her
* She ask's if we are interested in being hired to take care of the goblin problem
	* What she knows about the goblins
		* They are atacking the mines
		* They never seem to travel far so they seem to be based near the mines
		* There is rumors of something called cragma keep that seems to be lost to history. She assumes they are using cragma keep as their hideout
		* She doesn't seem thrilled about the miners federation
* We agree to work for her to deal with the black spider
* She stepped back 10 feet, yelled something in a loud voice. We felt a large force and she disapeared. We then hear a voice in our head saying "I will be in touch"
