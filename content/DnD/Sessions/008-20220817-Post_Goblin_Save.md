## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

Starting after we free the Goblin [[DnD/World/People/Ilk]].
* Fiona cleanes up his Lute with Prestidigitation
* Puss and I head up the stairs in the storage room to scout that area
	* There is a door. Which I pick the lock of.
	* In the next hallway I find a pit trap with a small ledge on one side. I scootch across past the pit trap
	* We pick the lock for the door after the trap
	* in the room are 3 sarcophagus and 2 doors. We hear some muffled conversation from 1 of the doors
	* I sneak to one sarcophagus. The image on top looks like flames and a drawing of a dragon
	* We sneak to the door with the voices and eavesdrop.
		* sounds like a couple of guards talking about how bored standing guard is... blah.. blah
		* I look under with my mirror but can't really see much
	* We head back to the rest of the group
	* Later we investigate the other door and find a stairway that leads up to another door
* The other's stay in the room. Keeking watch and investigating
	* farquad investigates the walls 
	* Aery investigates the supplies and finds general supplies like rope and rations, etc.
	* Faquad finds the outline of a secret door
		* Fiona determines that there is magic (from the school of abjuration) associated with the secret door. 
		* Fiona investigates and pieces together words in Draconic that say "the Lords name 3 times"
		* Puss realizes that the markings seem similar to what's on the sarcophugus
		* Fiona goes to investigate the sarcophugus
			* They say "We die so that you can rise"
			* This isn't enough info to figure out yet who the masters are
	* We decide we need to take out the guards so we get most everyone across
	* We get everyone across then make some noise and draw the guards in
