## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- We decide to buy the Inn
- We decide to rename the inn to "the Arcane massage"
- We are thinking about keeping the Inn and phandalain as a central base for the group where we can maybe do more one-offs and shorter campaigns
- for magic items we each can have 3 magic items active at any time
