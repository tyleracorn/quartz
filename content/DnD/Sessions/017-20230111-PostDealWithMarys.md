## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

After dealing with Marys and letting her go. We head back to town

When we enter the tavern, there is a male halfing that calls us over and says he is happy to be our new aquaintance
* We join the halfling
	* He introduces himself as Cyrus (Mistress Mary's Aid)
	* He pulls out 5 parchments and hands each of us one and explains that this is our employee contract with Marys
	* The contract states
		* We are the employed by Marys
		* our payment agreement (release of Ilk and keeping of the treasures we aquired from Mary's hidden cave)
	* He also hands us badges that we can use to show that we are employed by Marys if there are any issues
	* He slips us a document stating that our mining fee has been fulfilled, and we can now enter any mine in our search for the goblins
		* Each miner that enters a mine has to pay a fee to mine, and then get paid for anything they find
	* He also hands us a map of the surounding countryside including
		* mine locations
		* suspected locations of the goblin strongholds
* We go to sleap
* We are worried since marys and Cyrus maybe have access to some mind reading of us. So we head to splelunking to see if they have anything that can help us
	* She has one ring of mind shielding
	* She could make more but the supplies needed would take a while about a month
	* She wonders if there is something we have that is causing the dreams
	* I cast identify on the marble statue with the man holding a skull
		* It's enchanted - and it's the cause of the nightmares
		* As I try to pull it out of my satchel - something happens and I can't bring myself to expose it. Instead I am forced to cast Minor Illusion to show it to the others
		* It appears to be otherworldly
		* I ask them to look into some sort of material or contain that I could use to contain the statue in so that it doesn't affect others
* We go to the mining tavern and ask for some information
	* The goblin attacks seem sort of random
	* They always come from the surface and almost appears as if they are searching for something
	* The attacks on the miners appears more to be calatoral damage
* We head to the latest mine that was attacked by goblins #lyzas_tears
	* We notice that the goblin tracks come straight from the forested area and head straight to the mine entrance
	* We head into the mine - It's unnaturally quiet
	*
