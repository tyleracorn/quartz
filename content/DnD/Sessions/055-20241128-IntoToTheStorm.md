## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- as we are sailing into the storm we see one of the boats out of nowhere coming up on us. 
	- when they get close we start hurling spells at them.
	- meanwhile I am continuing to help #razortooth_mike manage the boat
- Puss does something trying to get us to the boat but instead ends up capsizing the boat
	- #razortooth_mike is killed though we find him and are trying to resucitate him
	- in the meantime #sashenstar familar starts rifling through #razortooth_mike pockets, I take offens and then #sashenstar is confused. I attack the hand of the familiar
- We notice that the water seems to be drawing us west but the wind is trying to draw us south. To the west seems dangerous and eventually someone in the group pushes us to follow the wind more than the water.
- NOTE deal with #sashenstar and the familiar next session
