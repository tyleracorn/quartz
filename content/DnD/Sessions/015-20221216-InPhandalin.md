## Session Summary

We talk to Sildar and find out that the goblin problem is getting worse, so he was heading out of town to try to get help from another Lords of Alliance outpost. We talk to him about Marys. We then talk to the wizards at the oddities shop and get their advice. We come to the conclusion that we either need to try to patch up our differences with Marys, or decide she's evil and kill her.

We then spend the rest of the day getting outfitted for new clothing, as we are expecting fall/winter to be approaching.

## Recap of Last Session

We fight the skeleton and destroy it after lifting it into the air where it couldn't really attack us. We learn a little more about Mary's. She apparently sits on the town council due to being a large business owner.  Marys is also the leader of the knights of the void. However, the knights were hired to deal with the goblin raids. The knights of the void are made up of the downtrodden and societies rejects.

## Log

* We get a message to meet up with Sildar. So we head towards the Lord's Alliance outpost
	* As we walk by the well we hear whispering that we can't really tell if it's coming from our head or the well. so I walk over to the well. 
	* Fiona tosses a coin in the well. I cast allusion and make it look like a ghostly hand emerges and snatches the coin
	* Fiona scoopes up some coins that might be cursed. Then tries to give one away. He stays behind to see if he can get someone to take the gold coin
	* The rest of us leave to go talk to Sildar when a figure approaches us and turns out to be Sildar.
		* He mentions that there have been more issues with not only the goblin raids and some issues with giants.
		* He also mentions local issues with a council member potentially missing
			* Might be attached to the black spider
			* Mentioned that Mary's formed the knights of the void from locals like orphan's and ex miners, etc.
		* Farquad mentions the "you die so we can die" ... and sildar recongnizes that as belonging to the dragon cult church trying to bring back the evil dragon Tiamat.
		* Sildar is heading to a neighboring town Tribor. 
		* We try to get Sildar alone, although he is in a rush to get to the next Lord's of the Alliance outpost to ask for more help.
			* He agrees to talk to us. To get him alone, we offer to walk him outside of town on his way to Trybor. He goes and grabs his white horse and starts walking East.
			* We talk to him about Marys. He is troubled, but beleives us. 
			* We ask who is trustworthy
				* Tomlin
				* The owner's of the Oddities shop #orin  and #inspera 
				* The blacksmith #marth_knox 
		* We head back into town.
			* Puss heads to the oddities shop
			* I head to the shanty town to hang out with the common folk.
				* The miner's federation doesn't seem well liked. It's dangerous work and doesn't pay well. I notice the owner's are charging 3 copper for dinner but, they only charge the miners 1/2 a copper. I take this to mean that the miner's don't get very much pay and they are helping them.
				* Everyone has been layed off due to the goblin problem. It seems like the town council has promised that it will be taken care of soon.
			* Puss talkes to Orin and Inspera about Merys
				* Orin suggests 2 paths
					* negotiate with her and release her OR
					* kill her and dispose of the body
				* Orin things that Merys might be an employee of someone else which could be good or bad
					* If we kill Mery's, it might be just a blip on Mery's employers radar or it might bring us to their attention which would be dangerous
					* If we negotiate with Mery's we could also come to Mery's employers radar as well.
				* They knew that something like the dragon tunnel's exhisted but they didn't think they were powerful enough to go down there.
					* Puss uses minor illusion to share with them we saw in the tunnels
					* Puss ask's about who Mery's is
						* Mery's doesn't value anyone who works for her or their lives.
						* She's powerful and not to be trifuled with.
			* Puss goes in search of a swashbuckler's hat and some general exploring the town.
				* We start getting winter coats
				* Fiona ask's about maybe lining his shadow coat.
					* and learns that it's glamer weave.
				* I get two clothing sets one dark and one light. both quiet clothing
				* I also get an outer winter coat that's dark on the outside and motled multicolored on the inside
