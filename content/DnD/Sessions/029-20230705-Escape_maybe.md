## Session Summary

We are able to get out of the collars suppressing our magic through Fiona seducing one of the goblin guards. The neutral goblins are un willing to escape with us, since they would rather not start a civil war among their fellows. We therefore sneak back into the keep and do  a quick search until we find our confiscated gear

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- Fiona seduces one of the guards
	- leads them away from the main gate
	- He convinces the guard to help him remove his collar
- I pick the lock 
- The guard then comes back with a rod with runes and says this will remove the collar but he doesn't know how to use it.
	- he asks for a reward first
	- Fiona kisses the guard
	- the guard gives him the rod
- Fiona is able to remove his collar
	- Fiona convinces the guard to give him the key
	- he gives the guard the hag finger
	- and convinces the guard to go to his tent
- Fiona hands the rod around to unlock our collars
- There's about 60+ other goblins locked up in the pen with us
- We go to release the collars of the elders and they stop us
	- They say they picked their fate, and releasing them would mean the blood of their loved ones
- We enter the keep to search for our gear taken from us
- We come into the main rrom and see the desk the black spider was behind
	- there are protective wards over the documents
	- we can see a map that is similar to gundrins but a little more detailed terrain wise while gundrins has a little more details of important features
	- There are 3 doors that are trapped
		- middle is a rune *unsure the spell*
		- the other two are physical traps
			- left and right a bolt will spring through the key hole to strike the person
			- we cast mage hand and remove the bolts 
			- Left door opens to a series of rooms that look like storage rooms
				- one of the rooms has pseudo hidden exit. It is more of a trick of the wall blending in, but you can't see the exit until you are right up against it.
			- We go into the right door, it's an armoury and we find our shit
			-
