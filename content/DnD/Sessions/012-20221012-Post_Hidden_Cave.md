## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

Fiona and I meet back up with the rest of the group in a room at the top of a tower. We loot some stuff, then head back down to the original room with the 3 sarcohpegous. We find the guards all destroyed. We surrmize that when we destroyed the 2 orbs, 2 skeletons were brought to life and killed everyone. We found the remains of 1 skeleton and heard the other one, so we ran out the passage the guards originally came down from. This lead us to what appeared to be an abandoned church with some bunk-beds. 

## Log

* We re-barricade the door entering the "church"
* Looking around we see a blood trail leading through the door going outside
	* Fiona opens the door to check outside, and a crossbow bolt almost hit him.
	* He hides behind a pew, then opens the door with mage-hand. We still can't see anything so he casts dancing lights in humenoid form and sends it out. Dancing lights are casts in return and surround his light
	* I look around the door with my mirror
		* I don't see any movement
		* I see just dense bush
	* The bartender comes in with a bunch of her goons
		* We fight. I have to drink a potion
		* Farquad gets the bartender tied up with her magic rope
		* Aery goes down, get's stabilized by ilk and has to drink a potion
		* Puss rushes over and gets the amulate over her
			*  he is the last one to speak to her so he is the only one who can take it off of her
		* we kill off the rest of the guards
	* We level up
