## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

We kill all of the guild people except for one bureaucrat who runs into the cave. We learn that the mine has been nearly exhausted, so the miners guild decided it wasn't worth rescuing the miners. It was more cost-effective for them to just blow the entrance and write off the miners, then try to save them from the goblins.

## Log

The warriors are wearing a flaked male chess piece
Aery and I notice that Ilk take one of the dagger's from the bodies and hides it on his person

We decide to head into the cave and rest just inside the cave

* Fiona hears someone shuffling and sees a miner with goblin arrows in him. He goes up to check on the miner and turns into a trap.
* A hobglobin puts magical shackles on Fiona.
	* The rest of us try to bolt. 
	* I get shot full of arrows and am knocked out
		* I pass my death saving throws
	* Everyone else gives up
	* The hobgoblin puts magically suppressing shackles on all of us
