I am traveling on a boat with 4 other passangers when the boat shipwrecks and the capitan leaves us. We band together and get a rough raft built and escape the sinking ship. We eventually make it to an island that appears almost completely deserted with the exception of one occupied building.

### Meeting Sorin Winterhill
* Mostly abandonded buildings but one occupied and lit that we approach. two stories and massive. Stonework is impectible 
* A drawf opens the door and welcomes us in.
	* Introduces himself as Sorin Winterhill and welcomes us to "Bloody Beach"
	* Place is empty
	* We ask about the beach and the island
		* Sorin crossed from the mainland and said he NEVER had a desire to cross the water again
			* Cousin Gundrin Rockseaker

### Chatting with Sorin the next morning
* Chat with Sorin about brewing. He offers me his traveling brewing supplies
* Chats with us and mentions a town called Phandolin that we might be interested in. His cousin Gundrin has decided to go find the "forge of spells" and has work that he would potentialy hire us for.
	* He gives a stamped coin (with an anvil stamped on it) and says if we are interested to show the coin to Gundrin and mention that Sorin sent us.
	* He gives us some liquor
	* He also says the world is a dangerous place and that we should adventure out without some sort of gear, and takes us to an armoury

### Leaving Bloody Beach
* Sorin takes us to some boats
	* It turns out that the mainland is only about 50m from the island.
* When we get to the mainland I suggest we head to phandolin and look for work. It seems like we compatible as a group.
	* I notice Puss being a little shifty/hesitant
* We head north along the trail
* Terrain is like the pacific north west
* While we walking towards phandolin Fiona feels something weird with the coin. The energy he felt before disapears. We all feal a surge in us. (Fiona would know that it would be like "aid" being cast on us)

### Goblin Ambush
* The wind shifts and we smell something dead up the trail
	* we proceed towards the smell to investigate
	* we see a cart overturned with 3 huminoud bodies and 3 horses. The bodies and horses are pin cushioned with arrows
	* We investigate. It's an ambush site. We can tell goblins attacked the carts from the ridges
	* 4 goblins attack us. 1 runs off. we kill the other 3
	* End before we get a chance to investigate

### Goblin Ambush - Continued

- Only 1 goblin is left which is what I'm chasing. I lose the goblin so come back to the group

- Yesik is captain  says #Clarg is bad. 
- Yesik tried to bargain. 
	- I told him to release the prisoner and we would help him with Clarg. 
	- He refused so I rushed in and killed him.
	- the last goblin is alive, I intimidate him. He says clarg is bad and clarg is further in the cave. Someone as low as grumby is not allowed where clarg is.

	* We head down to a room with storage room. There is a room and a set of stairs heading up

	* There is a door. Which I pick the lock of.
	* In the next hallway I find a pit trap with a small ledge on one side. I scootch across past the pit trap
	* We pick the lock for the door after the trap
	* in the room are 3 sarcophagus and 2 doors. We hear some muffled conversation from 1 of the doors
	* I sneak to one sarcophagus. The image on top looks like flames and a drawing of a dragon
	* We sneak to the door with the voices and eavesdrop.
		* sounds like a couple of guards talking about how bored standing guard is... blah.. blah
		* I look under with my mirror but can't really see much
	* We head back to the rest of the group
	* Later we investigate the other door and find a stairway that leads up to another door
* The other's stay in the room. Keeking watch and investigating
	* farquad investigates the walls

		* Puss realizes that the markings seem similar to what's on the sarcophugus
		* Fiona goes to investigate the sarcophugus
			* They say **"We die so that you can rise"**
			* This isn't enough info to figure out yet who the masters are
	* We decide we need to take out the guards so we get most everyone across
	* We get everyone across then make some noise and draw the guards in

We Enter into combat and end up taking out the guards in short order. One gets a chance to yell out but, at the end of the combat, we don't hear any other gaurds coming.
	* The guards are huminoid and are wearing the same type of armour as above in the bar 
	* They both have a brand on their left chest that looks similar to the image on the sarchophageous
* Puss and Fiona open up one of the sarcophageous. They see a human looking skeloton holding a clear orb inside. 
	* Fiona rases the orb up with mage hand and sees 2 leters underneath it.
	* They get the second sarcophageous open when we start hearing some footsteps
* We all have different plans on how to deal with the guards
	* 1 guard comes through, Fiona hears more gaurds coming so decides to close the door behind the 1st guard
	* I kill the 1st guard
	* Fiona scares them with some lights made to look like ghost
	* I go and help open the last sarcophagous
		* I see another skeleton with a clear orb
		* I would know enough to know that this is an evil god
		* Fiona rushes back towards the hidden door
		* Aery smashes 1 orb, I smash the other orb, the 3rd orb is gone
		* The guards are smashing through the door and it's starting to splinter
		* Everyone heads through the locked door that farquad unlocked. 
		* I rush after Fiona is chanting the name of the god 3 times (Tiamat) when I round the corner
			* the hidden door turns opaque. I tell Fiona what happened in the other room. 
			* Fiona says he wants to investigate and destroy Tiamat.
			* I agree and we step through the opaque door. Fiona says Tiamat 3 times and the doors turns solid again
			* Fiona tries to signal the others that we are ok with his dancing lights.
		* The others lock the door, head up the stairs and open the door at the top of the stairs

At the end we are split into 2 partys

Fiona and I enter the coridor behind the secret door. It's darker than it should be. 
	* It's hazy and darker than normal. almost like a mist
	* We proceed (investigating for traps). We finally come to a large room
	* Upon Entry to the room
		* We see two glowing eyes about 70 m away.
		* As soon as we enter the chamber - the fog clears but the entrance is still kind of foggy
		* We see that the two eyes are two sets of eyes are attached to two heads of a very detailed statue of a five-headed dragon.
		* Fiona investigates the 1st of the four sarcophegaous. It's empty

					* basin A is above the alters head
					* Basin D is about waste height (and is full)
		* We go investigate the alter
			* It's black ebony stone (can be dull and shiny at the same time)
			* It doesn't reflect light
			* We smell blood and it's stained
			* On top to the right is a dagger and on the left is bowl filled with the same orbs as where in the sarcophegous.
				* There are 8 orbs which are clear (whereas as the ones before were opaque)
				* The dagger is light and is made out of bone. It resembles a tooth with a handle
				* 
		* The 5 heads look similar but different colors
			* the colors going from bowls to the Sarcophegous
				* White, black, green, blue, red
			* The two active heads are looking down at the alter.
		* I pick up one orb and put it in basin A.
			* It moves a little
		* We turn the dragon heads to look at the alter. Their eyes glows and entrance we came in closes
		* We set the basins to mid height while the eyes are lit
		* One of the tiles behind the alter clicks. We push on it and it opens and there is a ladder heading down into thedark
* We enter the hidden passage behind the alter
	* We can see a glow at the end of the tunnel
	* We get to the end and there is another ladder which we head up to another room
* In the next room we see a giant flame and a door, a hook on the wall with a cloak hanging on it
	* nothing in the cloak. It's a full hooded cloak
	* Fiona puts on the cloak and it looks like he's made of shadow. 
	* We head through the door.

		* I was the only one who could take the pendant off of puss. It turns out I was the last one to talk to him before he put it on
	* Fiona is leading the way down the entrance the other party came through (through the mess hall). 
	* We come back into the room with the 4 sarcophegous and there are bodies everywhere
		* we see a blood trail that looks like someone (skeletal footprints) walked through the carnage, and they go through the door the guards originaly came through.

# Leaving the Hidden Cave

We re-barricade the door entering the "church"
* Looking around we see a blood trail leading through the door going outside
	* Fiona opens the door to check outside, and a crossbow bolt almost hit him.
	* He hides behind a pew, then opens the door with mage-hand. We still can't see anything so he casts dancing lights in humenoid form and sends it out. Dancing lights are casts in return and surround his light
	* I look around the door with my mirror
		* I don't see any movement
		* I see just dense bush
	* The bartender comes in with a bunch of her goons
		* We fight. I have to drink a potion
		* Farquad gets the bartender tied up with her magic rope

			*  he is the last one to speak to her so he is the only one who can take it off of her

	* We level up

* The forest it very heavily forested, and we have to bushwack.
* Everything is eirly quiet. 
* Fiona hears something coming from the bar that reminds him of the skeleton
* We pat down Marys and find a whip

# Back in Phandalin

Fighting the Skeleton
	* I push the skeleton back into the moonbeam
	* with the skeleton trapped in levitate we destroy it
* When I killed the skeleton, I felt a sharp headache, but it vanished quickly
* We went back to the inn for a long rest
	* In our dreams
		* We all have the same dream of a loved one or friend getting brutally murdered by an unseen force
		* Fiona keeps getting a voice in his head that he feels an unwilling but powerful connection asking him to release him from the vial and he'll grant him one wish
* We head over to Splenkins
	* We ask about Marys. 
		* She sit's on the town council because she's a business owner
		* She bought the Hidden Toes when she came into town
		* she is the leader of the knights of the void which were hired to deal with the goblin raids
		* The knights of the void are made up of the downtrodden and societies rejects
		* She's friends with or works with
			* the mining federation (they took the brunt of the goblin raids)
			* the town master
			* branthem sits on the town council
	* I ask about local myths
		* She says there's a lot of gods and evil in this world but she doesn't involve herself in that
			* I can tell she's holding back
			* Phandelin was once built near a place where a dragon cult that was trying to bring the evil dragon Tiamat back
	* We get them to identify some of the "items" we found
We get a message to meet up with Sildar. So we head towards the Lord's Alliance outpost
	* As we walk by the well we hear whispering that we can't really tell if it's coming from our head or the well. so I walk over to the well. 
	* Fiona tosses a coin in the well. I cast allusion and make it look like a ghostly hand emerges and snatches the coin
	* Fiona scoopes up some coins that might be cursed. Then tries to give one away. He stays behind to see if he can get someone to take the gold coin
	* The rest of us leave to go talk to Sildar when a figure approaches us and turns out to be Sildar.
		* He mentions that there have been more issues with not only the goblin raids and some issues with giants.
		* He also mentions local issues with a council member potentially missing
			* Might be attached to the black spider
			* Mentioned that Mary's formed the knights of the void from locals like orphan's and ex miners, etc.
		* Farquad mentions the "you die so we can die" ... and sildar recongnizes that as belonging to the dragon cult church trying to bring back the evil dragon Tiamat.
		* Sildar is heading to a neighboring town Tribor. 
		* We try to get Sildar alone, although he is in a rush to get to the next Lord's of the Alliance outpost to ask for more help.
			* He agrees to talk to us. To get him alone, we offer to walk him outside of town on his way to Trybor. He goes and grabs his white horse and starts walking East.
			* We talk to him about Marys. He is troubled, but beleives us. 
			* We ask who is trustworthy
				* Tomlin
				* The owner's of the Oddities shop #orin  and #inspera 
				* The blacksmith #marth_knox 
		* We head back into town.
			* Puss heads to the oddities shop
			* I head to the shanty town to hang out with the common folk.
				* The miner's federation doesn't seem well liked. It's dangerous work and doesn't pay well. I notice the owner's are charging 3 copper for dinner but, they only charge the miners 1/2 a copper. I take this to mean that the miner's don't get very much pay and they are helping them.
				* Everyone has been layed off due to the goblin problem. It seems like the town council has promised that it will be taken care of soon.
			* Puss talkes to Orin and Inspera about Merys
				* Orin suggests 2 paths
					* negotiate with her and release her OR
					* kill her and dispose of the body
				* Orin things that Merys might be an employee of someone else which could be good or bad
					* If we kill Mery's, it might be just a blip on Mery's employers radar or it might bring us to their attention which would be dangerous
					* If we negotiate with Mery's we could also come to Mery's employers radar as well.
				* They knew that something like the dragon tunnel's exhisted but they didn't think they were powerful enough to go down there.
					* Puss uses minor illusion to share with them we saw in the tunnels
					* Puss ask's about who Mery's is
						* Mery's doesn't value anyone who works for her or their lives.
						* She's powerful and not to be trifuled with.
			* Puss goes in search of a swashbuckler's hat and some general exploring the town.
				* We start getting winter coats
				* Fiona ask's about maybe lining his shadow coat.
					* and learns that it's glamer weave.
				* I get two clothing sets one dark and one light. both quiet clothing
				* I also get an outer winter coat that's dark on the outside and motled multicolored on the inside
I pick up some honey and put it in my poison flask.
We sneak Marys back out of the city and find a clearing in the woods to talk to her. I investigate and make sure nobody is around us
* We take the hood and amulet off of her
* She ask's if we are interested in being hired to take care of the goblin problem
	* What she knows about the goblins
		* They are atacking the mines
		* They never seem to travel far so they seem to be based near the mines
		* There is rumors of something called cragma keep that seems to be lost to history. She assumes they are using cragma keep as their hideout
		* She doesn't seem thrilled about the miners federation
* We agree to work for her to deal with the black spider
* She stepped back 10 feet, yelled something in a loud voice. We felt a large force and she disapeared. We then hear a voice in our head saying "I will be in touch"

After dealing with Marys and letting her go. We head back to town

When we enter the tavern, there is a male halfing that calls us over and says he is happy to be our new aquaintance
* We join the halfling
	* He introduces himself as Cyrus (Mistress Mary's Aid)
	* He pulls out 5 parchments and hands each of us one and explains that this is our employee contract with Marys
	* The contract states
		* We are the employed by Marys

	* He also hands us badges that we can use to show that we are employed by Marys if there are any issues
	* He slips us a document stating that our mining fee has been fulfilled, and we can now enter any mine in our search for the goblins
		* Each miner that enters a mine has to pay a fee to mine, and then get paid for anything they find
	* He also hands us a map of the surounding countryside including
		* mine locations
		* suspected locations of the goblin strongholds
* We go to sleap
* We are worried since marys and Cyrus maybe have access to some mind reading of us. So we head to splelunking to see if they have anything that can help us

	* She could make more but the supplies needed would take a while about a month
	* She wonders if there is something we have that is causing the dreams
	* I cast identify on the marble statue with the man holding a skull
		* It's enchanted - and it's the cause of the nightmares
		* As I try to pull it out of my satchel - something happens and I can't bring myself to expose it. Instead I am forced to cast Minor Illusion to show it to the others
		* It appears to be otherworldly
		* I ask them to look into some sort of material or contain that I could use to contain the statue in so that it doesn't affect others
* We go to the mining tavern and ask for some information
	* The goblin attacks seem sort of random
	* They always come from the surface and almost appears as if they are searching for something
	* The attacks on the miners appears more to be calatoral damage
* We head to the latest mine that was attacked by goblins #lyzas_tears
	* We notice that the goblin tracks come straight from the forested area and head straight to the mine entrance
	* We head into the mine - It's unnaturally quiet

	* We head down the left branch deaper. 
	* We come to a giant opening and find an underground lake
	* We had back then go down the right passage

		* We get back to farquad. When we hear the mother with a gross suction sound
		* I cast minor illusion at a narrow spot that's only about 5 ft wide, we all went past the illusion to hide.
		* The Mother drops down so we can see her now She's about 15 ft toll and 40 ft or more longer
			* The mother starts eating the dead grubs

				* arys deals moonbeam damage to it
				* fiona charms it
				* arys deals moonbeam damage again
				* It runs away
 I look up in the ceiling, I see where the worm ran off, but I can't see it or hear anything
* Aeyis explanes what it was. a carion crawler
	* They produce venom through their tentacles and when they latch on they inject
	* They tend to live alone
	* They sometimes eat their own offspring

* 1 miner is still alive his name is gavin
	* He was attacked by goblins 
	* They set up the cave-in 
	* They had a backup escape setup
	* When he realizes that he is pretty bad shape, he gives us a simple ring with a stone set in it and ask to give it to his sister

* We had back to the lake
* When we get near the cave in we can hear something large moving around on the other side of the cavein
* We take a long rest at the lake
	* Again we have the same horrible nightmare
	* This time however, the nightmares affect us so much that we only get half the health and spell slots back that we should have
We are camped out at the lake underground, waiting for the water to recede so that we can escape.
* after a couple of days
	* we see some rippling in the water
	* I throw a rock, we see it hit the water but there is no sound
	* We start hearing voices that are almost 
	* I tell them again about the statue again and that I can't show it them. 
	* Puss ask's if he can see it so I tell him it's in my bag and I open it, I can see the statue but puss can't
	* Aeyr senses that there is a very strong illusion magic coming from my bag.
	* I drop the bag then walk away
		* after a get about 40 ft I stop hearing the whispering but I start feeling sick and almost compelled that I need to go back to the bag
	* Fiona casts see invisiblility and he can see the invisible statue but he can't grab
	* In the darkness I am able to pull the statue out of the bag, but when I go to put it down I can't let go. Even when I go to put back in the bag I can't let go.
	* I put myself to sleep
		* Fiona shot the statue a couple of times with firebolt and it was cracked
		* when I woke up, I stabbed the stature with my dagger. Each time it hurt me just as much as it hurt the stature. eventually the damage broke however.
	* After the statue breaks we are temporaily blinded by a bright flash and then we roll intitiative
		* Right next to me is a woman on the ground who appears unconcous and dressed in fine clothes
	* Fiona yells out Hag!! and shoots magic missile
	* I stab her a little to see if hurting her still hurts me
	* when I try to get up she grabs my hand and says help me
		* I believe her
	* Fiona keeps shooting her with magic missile
	* she finally looks at all of us and says "I only require my property, (pointing to me) and then I'll let the rest of you live" then shoots fiona and knocks him out with a second magic missile 

I stabalize Fiona, The hag puts me to sleep

	* We surmize that they are hallucinating
* We take a third point of exhaustion
# Leaving the Mines and back to Phandalin

* We start hearing slow clapping and we see Marys standing near us. She starts a fire 15 feet away from us
* There is a pot of stew on the fire that she offers to us
* She informs us that there have been 2 other attacks. She's going to take the left over people she has to go investigate one of the attack locations, and she says we should go investigate the other.

	* Looks like a group of miners arguing with another group that's all one in one uniform that looks like the miner's guild
	* We decide to approach the two groups and ask what's going on.
	* The miner's deep in the mine were attacked by goblins and the guild is wanting to blow the entrance and seal in the goblins. The Miner's are arguing, the guild doesn't want to wait.

It states that if it's possible (as long as it's not too difficult) they should try to rescue the miners. However, the insurance they have on the miner's means they would come out with profits either way.
		* I chat with farquad about converting one of the longbows into a shortbow
The warriors are wearing a flaked male chess piece
Aery and I notice that Ilk take one of the dagger's from the bodies and hides it on his person

We decide to head into the cave and rest just inside the cave

	* The hobgoblin puts magically suppressing shackles on all of us
 I come to after being partially healed by the goblins but with a bag over my head. 
* They stripped us of our posession but didn't remove any jewlery
* I start trying to pay as much attention as I can to where we being taken and what I can hear or smell around me. 
	* They take us out of the cave, taking us through the bush. Based on the sound and smell, it doesn't seem like we are with the main group of goblins. 
	* We can still hear the one hobglobin.
	* After about an hour we are hoisted up into what seems like a wagon. We can smell horses.
	* We aren't alone in the wagon.
* I remove my hood.
	* We are in an iron cage on top of a wagon along with 15 other miners. I hear some shouts and the wagon starts moving. 
	* There are 6 wagons with 1 driver and 1 guard, and hobglobin on a horse.
	* The miners don't have any handcuffs on. Their hands are free.
* We travel for a couple of hours
	* Meanwhile I try to get info from the miners what happened
		* They were all recently captured just hours before we showed up.
		* They were captured from Grand Venture mine (we were at the Eden Mine).
		* The grand venture mine is where Marys went to
		* I try to give the miners some hope and comfort. They start feeling better
	* We come up to a smoother more ancient seeming road.
* We come up to some structures
	* There are multiple fires with hundreds of goblins around them
	* There are a few towers but they are weathered and somewhat crumpled
	* There is a drawbridge but the moat is dry
	* After we enter the entrance is shut with an iron gate
	* We can also see some shadows up on the ramparts
* The wagon stops and they unload us
	* The miners are taken through one path of the fortress
	* The hob globin decides that he will escort us as a special prize for the boss
		* The goblins call hime #Argov
	* He leads us into the fortress and into a grand chamber
		* It's a square room by about 100 ft by 300 wide
		* There are stone statues (some of them have smashed) and they look dwarven made
		* At the far end is a thick ornate table with some weird magical lamps that are glowing
		* There are 4 different entrances, 2 off of each side.
		* Standing in front of the table is a person that is the spitting image of #Marys, and she is talking to a halfling.
			* The halfling walks away through one of the side doors
		* When the person turns we see that one side of the face is the spitting image of #Marys but the other half of the face is burned horribly
		* She gets mad that Ilk is with us saying "why is their kind here" and gets some guards to come and drag him away.
			* Aeyr trys to grab Ilk but she gets back handed
		* She says #mavehous fix this.
			* A tiefling seems to appear out of nowhere and magically stablizes Aery and then poors a healing potion down their throat
		* She Tells Argov. "No times for games. As long as her pieces off of the board. We only need 1 more gem, Either put them into the games or make them diggers it doesn't matter. We have 5 days before we hit the last site. It doesn't matter."
	* Argov leads us away. We eventually down some stairs into a dark, wet area. Argov is grumbling to himself and he sounds unsure of himself.
		- We eventually come to a room with rows and rows and rows of cells. All of them are empty except for one that has a lump in a corner we can't really see.
		- He puts us in the cell next to the one occupied and lines us up
			- The tiefling appears and puts a collar around our neck. After the collar is around our neck he removes the shackles
			- We still don't have access to magic
			- Across from us and down the room is a table with 3 other hobglobins
			- The Teifling smiles at us then dissapears 
		- It turns out the person in the cell next to us #Gundrin 
		- Farquad asks if he found the #forge_of_spells 
			- He gets too emotional and says that if it wasn't for his quest then #Zaron the drow witch, wouldn't have used his map to get so much power.
		- I ask gundrin about the collars around our neck. He says he doesn't know much about them but says they aren't dwarven but are ancient. 
		- I ask Gundrin about the teifline
			- He looks ashamed and  says he was approached by her in neverwinter and he let spill about his mission about the #forge_of_spells . 
		- Puss asks if he knows what's the pieces are that #Zaron is looking for
			- He doesn't think #forge_of_spells exhists. She's after something more sinister. She needs 5 gems to get it. Each gem is a dwarven key to a storage/treasure. 
		- Gundrin says if we could escape he could get to the gem first. But he doesn't think he can escape
		- I try to pick the lock but am unsuccesful 
	- Argov shows up in the morning. Says it's time for some fun. Puts shackles on #Gundrin and opens our cell, then leads us out. We can start hearing a lot of commotion. We are lead out into a courtyard with a 20 ft pit with crude stands set up around it.
	- Gundrin lowers himself down into the pit.
	- Argov selects me and pushes me into the pit.
I spend a while trying to taunt and convince the goblins that this is a week fight. Gundrin finally convinces me that he wants me to kill him so I eventually attack.
- While fighting #Gundrin he slips something under my armour
- I end up killing #Gundrin 
- Shakles are put on me as I come out the pit
- We are taken off to a pen in a camp. The pen is filled with some goblins.
- Ilk is in the pen
	- Fiona askes him if anyone in the group can help us get the shakles and collars off
	- Ilk runs to some goblins that look like they are elders chats with them and brings us a lock pick
	- We pick our locks
- Fiona talks with the chiefs and asks if there is any way they could help us escape and that we would help set them free if we can if we can escape
- One side of the pen is near an open forest. The other side of the pen is near the gate and the camp. about 30ft beyond the camp is more forest
- There are 18 guards. 4 at each corner, 8 are guarding the gate. The rest are walking
	- We can't quite make out what the characters are on the parapet of cragmaw.
- I look at what gundrin slipped which turns out to be some pieces of paper
	- 1 that is a map that looks like mine locations 
	- 1 is a note in dwarvish
	- 1 is another note in dwarvish with a homemade key
		- I recognize that it is a very rare form of a skeleton key
- They come up with a plan to hide some of us in a cart leaving the camp. this wouldn't work with for me since I'm too large
# Escape from the Goblins

Fiona seduces one of the guards
	- leads them away from the main gate
	- He convinces the guard to help him remove his collar
- I pick the lock 
- The guard then comes back with a rod with runes and says this will remove the collar but he doesn't know how to use it.

	- the guard gives him the rod
- Fiona is able to remove his collar

- Fiona hands the rod around to unlock our collars
- There's about 60+ other goblins locked up in the pen with us
- We go to release the collars of the elders and they stop us
	- They say they picked their fate, and releasing them would mean the blood of their loved ones
- We enter the keep to search for our gear taken from us
- We come into the main rrom and see the desk the black spider was behind
	- there are protective wards over the documents
	- we can see a map that is similar to gundrins but a little more detailed terrain wise while gundrins has a little more details of important features
	- There are 3 doors that are trapped
		- middle is a rune *unsure the spell*
		- the other two are physical traps
			- left and right a bolt will spring through the key hole to strike the person
			- we cast mage hand and remove the bolts 
			- Left door opens to a series of rooms that look like storage rooms
				- one of the rooms has pseudo hidden exit. It is more of a trick of the wall blending in, but you can't see the exit until you are right up against it.
			- We go into the right door, it's an armoury and we find our shit
We head back to the illusion/hidden passage and decide to check it out
	- it's dark and we can't see very far
	- drops off pretty quickly
	- smells like earth and water?
- We go back to the door with a spell on it.
	- It's locked, I'm able to unlock it with magehand.
	- We push open the door with magehand and see a long hallway with a door at the other end.
	- Puss throws a breastplate through the door
	- A fireball spell is released by the trap hitting Puss and Fiona. This trips the trap so no spell is in the doorway anymore
	- We go through into the room at the end of the hall way and find a desk, some journals written in a coded language, a couple armoires, and a bed
		- there are some drawings in the journals that we can see #black_spyder_journal.
			- Detailed sketches of some caverns

		- Ilk Finds
			- A blanket of warmth. Keeps user warm no matter the weather
	- We see out of the corner of our eyes in the hallway, the teifling #mavehous that was talking to the black spyder. She's blended into the shadows and we more see the glimmer of the shadows surrounding her. She winks at us and turns and run.
	- #mavehous stabs a sigil in the desk sounding off an alarm and causing the doors on the side of the room to slam shut
		- we chase after her.
		- she is heading out the main entrance towards the camp. we are fighting as she runs
		- she is just at the exit hallway and is looking pretty haggard.
			- puss and I are in striking distance of her.

#mavehous turns to me and say that "clan" recognizes "clan" and that she recognizes my fighting style and that she can smell balders gate on puss' fur. She says dying wouldn't be a service to her mistress and says something about running. Then disappears in a shower of silver. 

- #puss starts running towards the entrance to look for farquad
	- I follow and start readying some caltrops with poison
	- I sneak up can to see 6 guards at the entrance. They sound scared saying they aren't ready to hold of an invasion.
	- We are all still pretty beat up so decide we can't attack and will have to escape and find farquad later
# Escape into the Dwarven Caves
- We head back to the hidden exit that smells dank and super old. When we come to some stairs heading down
- We head down the stairs, and it takes quite awhile. It looks all dwarven and all immaculate. Smells of despair, though.
- We get to the ground floor and enter a square room with dwarven statues on the wall. There is one hallway, we walk down it. See one door on the side which we can't open. I decide not to use the skeleton key
- At the end of the hall are two offshoots, stairs that head up and to the left and one that heads down and to the right. The moss points to the right and down
- We continue to follow the moss. But at one point smell what smells like metal, but points away from the moss. We follow the smell and find a forge
	- The forge is cold, hasn't been operated for a while.
	- There are some ingots of silver and a metal we don't really recognize that's really lite weight.
		- We take 10 silver ingots
		- We take 6 special metal ingots
- We head back to where the moss was pointing
	- come to some ornate doors that the moss is pointing to along with some small doors to the side of the ornate door that are locked.
	- We use the skeleton key to unlock the door. It works, but the key looks flimsier and a slightly damaged
		- it goes down some more halls. It eventually enters a throne room with a dwarven skeleton in ornate armor holding an ornate hammer, with 3 arrows sticking out of the skeleton.
		- We investigate, and it looks like the throne has similar seams. 
			- I find two compartments on the throne that look like they might be key holes.
			- we decide to not use they skeleton key again unless we have to
	- We go back to the ornate doors. There are 3 holes and some runes. Fiona casts comprehend languages
		- The runes say  "Thomumlir Mountainspine grants you safe journey."
	- We stick 3 hands in and find something and twist. Our hands are locked in place. The outline of the king and his hammer is eliminated his name flashes 3 times.
Aeyr tries to pick up the hammer at the foot of the dwarven king skeleton. It blasts her back then the skeleton stands up
	- The king speaks out "unwelcome visitors why do you disturb our slumber"
- Aeyr explains what we are trying to escape from and that her companions are stuck in the door. 
- The king asks her to take him to us
- the king laughs at us and says something about "oh more non dwarvish kind trying to enter my kingdom un invited"
- we ask for safe passage he agrees if we give him a personal item each.
	- I give him the whiskey for thorin. He takes a sip, says it's been forever since he's had true dwarven whiskey.. 
		- He releases us
		- then says - the whiskey is for the living not the dead and hands it back to me
	- I ask him if he'll translate the Gundrin's note
		- he is hesitant. and I explain about gundrin died giving it to us
		- the note is how to open the ancient.
			- Needs 5 specific orbs placed in certain spots around the ancient forge
		- He asks that we not meddle in ancient dwarven magic
		- I explain that the black spyder has 3 of the orbs already. 
			- He looks pretty shook, then hands me his hammer and says this is the closest he can do to help us.
		- As the king walks away, he slips a knife from his belt to Ilk.
		- The hammer is heavy
- We go through the door, and it closes behind us.
- We take a long rest
- We head down the tunnel. It's heading downward slightly. We start to hear rushing water
- At the end of the path. There is a rail track with some upturned mining carts and a raging river
- We turn over some of the carts. and decide to jump in and ride the cart
- We get going pretty fast
- Fiona and I start using mage hand to try to slow us down slightly
- We leave the tunnel and see the rail go up in the air... and the track is damage. 
	- We start to jump. Aeyr get's stuck and Puss, Ilk, and I try to help. 
	- Fiona jumps clear
	- The rest of us go over with the cart
	- We land in a lake and get hurt
	- Ilk is knocked unconscious
	- We make our way to the shore 
# Leaving the Caves and entering the Forest

Fiona makes his way down to us. Only half of our rations survive
- We take a long rest
- we start foraging as we are trying to find our way out of the forest
- We continue in the direction where the rail tracks was following around the mountain
- we don't really feel like we are finding our way out
- Aery turns into a tree, then chats with the trees around us. 
	- They mention another 3 groups that have intruded on the trees. One of the groups they seem apprehensive about. the other 2 are younger and they are unsure about them.
	- The other groups are about 2 days away. 
- We decide to go and try to find the other group
- We start hearing some noise that sounds like a lite tune. we are able to follow it and head towards it.
- Puss and I sneak up. As we get close we see a rectangular clearing. At the far side we see 3 creatures 
	- rock gnome
	- goat
	- something between halfling and half elf. really fair skin almost goldish or even almost metallic sheen
- the torches are floating and the harp is playing itself
- Only the not halfling not half elf is doing the talking and it's laughing at it's own jokes
- We enter and announce ourselves. the not elf person looks friends and happily beckons us forward offering us food and drink
- Aeyr does an arcana check is all over the map. there's lots of magic going on.
- He points to the goat and introduces him as Mertc
- We introduce ourself
- He introduces himself as Fel-elicity. He seems to be moving with a limp
	- Puss asks him about the limp. he passes it off as some other group not friendly
	- he tries to pour us wine but he seems to have a hard time pouring and spills it
- He seems suspicious but we aren't really sure what's going on
- I decide to go ahead and eat some of the food.. then my eyes glaze over and I have a slunk look like the rock gnome and the goat
Every one else ends up taking the food, and we are all drugged.
Nothing is wrong, but everything around us is vibrant. The quiet forest has come to life. The goat and gnome are awake, and you are able to talk to them. Anyone that didn't eat seems blurry
- Felicity is happy and says "see this is a safe space, eat and be happy".
- Fiona asks Felicity has heard about the blackspyder
	- He says he's heard the name but can't remember anything else. Then starts talking about some problem with the giants.
- Felicity introduces us to the rock gnome and the goat
- Mer is the goat and Harkess is the rock gnome
- Fiona says the safe word and is booted out of the group
- I talk to Felicity and convince him to help bring this safe/drugged space to others like the black spyder. He then gives us a bag and says this should give you enough for 10 trips
	- we open the bag, and it's filled with dead leaves from the forest
	- he warns to not take them out within the forest. It's not totally legit.  But it was already dead, so it's sort of ok by the tree's own rules
- Fiona gets the feeling that we are being watched and noticed that felicity also seems to sense it
- Aeyr says the safe word, and we are all booted. We all feel fully rested and feel so rejuvinated that get advantage on our next roll.
- Felicity talks about some danger... but then is staring off to the left and then says something about he doesn't feel like we are alone anymore and that he has a feeling we'll be interrupted soon.
- He warns us that there are others like him that treat people like us badly
- we hear some noise. We get ready
- I hide near the side of the woods where the noise is coming from and I am super well hidden
- 4 shapes step out
	- 1 Drows
	- 2 kobolds (1 red, 1 blue)
	- 1 Tiefling
- They in a blue and black color scheme that is coordinated, and it seems familiar
- The drow says "I told you we would find it.. Stop damaging the trees! And stares at the Tiefling"
- Harkness address the group... their eventual response is "if you know what's good for you, you'll get away from that worm (Felicity).
- The drow whistles.. And from the opposite side of the clearing 6 more figures come out
	- 2 goblins
	- 1 orc
	- 3 drow
- The Main drow says enough talk and draws her bow. Her arrows don't look like standard arrows
	- they are long, black, and have corkscrew tipped arrows dripping
- I coat my dagger and shortsword with poison
- Fiona holds his action ready to toss firebolt if attacks happen
The group that steps out and we are confronting are:
- 4 drow
- 2 orc
- 2 kobolds
- 1 tiefling

Initiative order
- puss 20
- tia 17
- felicity 16
- fiona 11
- Harkness and Mer 7
- Aery and Ilk - 3

The Drow says enough and starts pulling back her bow shoots at Felicity, misses and almost hits Ilk.
We start fighting.
- I sneak up behind the drow
- one of the drow misses their shot and hits a tree...
	- aery gets the immediate feeling that the forest is pissed
- I attack from hiding getting a #surprise_attack and kill a drow
- Puss takes out 1 creature
- I get a dreadfull feeling from the trees around me.
	- I try to communicate to the trees that I'll help them take care of the people hurting them
- I kill another drow
	- afterwards vines come out of the ground and drag the drow's body into the forest
- Aery Roasts 2 goblins with moonbeam
The group that steps out and we are confronting are:
- 4 drow
- 2 orc
- 2 kobolds
- 1 tiefling

Initiative order
- puss 20
- tia 17
- felicity 16
- fiona 11
- Harkness and Mer 7
- Aery and Ilk - 3

Fight continues:
- Drow 1 yells "Enough of this" and reaches into her cloak to draw out an orb.
	- we recognize the orb as the same type as what he found in the basement but instead of white it's filled with a blue smoke, which she smashes and inhales the smoke
	- We have to do a constitution save throw
		- We see a flash of a shape that looks like a dragon and are we are now scared, so all our rolls are at disadvantage and can't move towards her
- The drow blows up shouting out a lightning attack that sets the forest on fire and knocks out #Felicity. Felicity tosses ilk into a rope trick portal before getting knocked out
- We get Ilk back and load up Felicity on Mer
- We head away from the fire and head down the path the drow group came from
- The forest is more quiet than normal and we get a weird feeling
- I study the poisoned arrow some but can't figure it out
- I give Felicity some of the tree leaves. This snaps him awake.
- It's starting to snow which Felicity noticies and says is bad. Really bad.
	- The forest is somewhat sentient but it's dying now and we are in the middle of it.
- Felicity says he can probably get us out of there but we have to close our eyes and not open them it might not work
	- It works..Seems like we are flying. Then he realizes he doesn't really know where to take us.
	- He eventually says he sees a settlement so takes us down.
	- It turns out it's the goblin settlement, but it's been destroyed including the goblins and the councel of old goblins. Bodies everywhere.
	- We don't see the body of Farquad.
- The burning looks similar to what happened to the forrest
- I asked about the group... but Felicity says he's not sure if he can tell us.
- We look around and enter the Fortress to see what we can find
	- When we enter the chamber we see the bodies of the bugbear that made us fight, the half drow that we ran into on our escape and on dais we see the body of the black spyder (Merys look alike)
After the previous fight, we level up.
# Back to Cragma
Felicity brings us to cragma and we find now that everyone is killed included the #black_spyder, her minions, and the goblins enslaved by their own kind.
- We investigate the bodies and find
- On Bugbear
	- stab wounds and caved in skull
	- 6 gold
	- great axe
- Half Drow
	- multiple stab wounds
	- 35 gold
	- a plethora of daggers
- #black_spyder 
	- She is burned but still alive just unconscious
	- 3 soul orbs they are white and empty
	- In her hand we find a dwarvish orb
		- This is the type of orb that the #black_spyder was saying that they found 4 of the five.
	- We tie up the #black_spyder 
- Fiona examines the special orb and it's warm
- I hold the dwarvish orb and cast identify
- During long rest I hear some claining sound
	- It sounds like it's coming towards us and it sounds like some thing is striking the wall.
	- There is a very strong rank order coming down the passageway
- Out comes an ogre and a goblin which say "oh she said there would be leftovers!"
- A battle commences
	- we kill both the ogre and the goblin
After killing the ogre and goblin, we check out the bodies. We don't find anything.
I search around and find a crossbow painted blue
We take a long rest
- I take the potion of mind reading
	- We get flashes of a war machine
	- We see her being commanded by a fiery voice to find the #vonindod
	- we can't tell who is commanding her
	- I also see flashes of giants and dragons
	- Also get flashes of the dwarvish orbs and there is sense of triumph especially the last one which we found on her. 
	- There is an ancient way against giants and dragons
		- dragons have historically been the top of the food chain
		- giants wanted that
	- There was an epic war between them
	- The giants created the #vonindod to ravage the land. It got destroyed, but part of it was buried below the town of #Phandalin .
	- She was sent by someone to find the #vonindod
	- She is on the side of giants
	- the orbs open the chamber where the dwarfs kept the portion of the #vonindod that they had. And the last orb, which is the one we found, powers the portion of the #vonindod
	- I ask what happened to the other orbs
		- Our employer has the other 5
	- I ask if they are sisters
		- She says the drow families are complicated
	- Aery heals her some when she starts coughing up blood
		- she seems shocked and unsure
	- we get images of mary's group being the group that attacked her and stole the orbs
	- I ask if she wants revenge
		- there is fear but the fear is more that she's afraid of when her masters' find out that they failed.
	- #Marys is on the side of the dragons
	- I don't get any sense of deception from her
- I take Ilk and leave the room and #Aery follows me
- Fiona then kills #black_spyder after we leave the room
- We go look for some sign of #farquad all that we find is his bottle that held his hand sanitizer.
	- #Aery realizes that #farquad would still be alive based on what she knows about the spell they used for the sanitizer 
- We leave cragma and eventually find our way to the cave where we were captured
# Back to Phandalin
- As we approach #Phandalin we see black smoke on the horizon
	- We find bodies of miners that look pretty brutalized
	- we find some bodies of goblins, ogres, and bugbears mixed in
	- As well as some bodies from the #lords_alliance group
- The slums are burned down
- There's some damage to the miners guild building but it looks mainly untouched.
- We walk through town to #spelunkin 
	- It looks relatively untouched but we can tell some spells have happened around there
	- Doors is locked but no one answers
	- we try picking the lock and trip a trap knocking us off the porch 

I head over to the Lord's Alliance. It looks hastily abandoned but there's a note 
	- the Note says if there are any survivors to head to the safe location in the woods. 
- I head to the Inn. As I enter, I hear some slight rustling from upstairs.
- I sneak upstairs and find #Tomlin the inn keeper hastily packing.
	- She says #Phandalin is no longer safe
	- 3 nights' past there was an alarm that the slums were on fire during the night then they were set upon by unknown assailants that were goblins, humans, hobglobins, drow, etc.
	- She explains that there is an old abandoned outpost about half a day's hike away.
	- They heard a large eruption like an earthquake and the attacking army dispersed 
	- I ask about the owners of the #spelunkin
		- Most of the survivors owe their lives to them and they are tending wounded at the outpost.
	- To reach the outpost take the road to the south past the giant's toe
- I head to the giant's toe and investigate to see if maybe the army was searching for the hidden tunnel below the bar.
	- On the way, we notice that it looks like 5 of the dwarven statues are missing.
	- It seems like the ground has been disturbed and some scorch marks on the pedestals.
	- I pull out the dwarvish hammer and the inscription is glowing
		- Harkness relates that the symbols are ancient 
	- The statues are the same as on the map that #Gundrin gave me
		- The map shows the order that orbs should be placed on the statue in order to open up a vault below.
	- We check out the miner's guild
		- We find some documents showing the loss (in deaths) that's acceptable for different mines/profit expectations
		- Talia Thornton is the president of this regions guild
		- We find 3 safes. 1 is person sized and the other 2 are about half the size
			- I cast identify. The large safe is warded with a fire-ball spell
			- 1'st small safe is stacks of documents all written in code that we can't understand.
			- 2nd small safe is filled with gold and gems
				- 190 gold and 600 silver
				- Some gems
			- Fiona got stabbed twice trying to loot the desk in the room.
			- We eventually get the door to open. trip the fireball spell which sets off explosives in the safe
	- We check out the giant's toe. we infer that maybe 
	- We are missing puss
		- Last time we saw puss was when we were studying the statues. so I go back to search for him there.
I don't find Puss at the status so I go check out the well and find Puss on a rope checking out the bottom of the well.
- Puss explains what he was doing
	- He was scoping it out, and he found a group of 6 hobgloblins, goblins, and drows guarding an entrance to some caves
- We had back to the inn and take a #long_rest . We then decide to head back to the well and explore the caves
# Hidden tunnels at the bottom of the well
- We all take the rope and work our way down the well
- we drop the goat into the water
	- the goat, and harkness are starting to drown
	- I slide now and pull them out
- we finally get everyone down and into the ledge
We see two goblins who are surprised by what they just saw. We see an alarm bell past them
	- We surprise enough that we end up bluffing our way past the goblins.
	- There is a door that we proceed through
- We see an image of the dwarves constructed a weapon like this below to beat the dragons
We find some machinery. We get it working. It makes a lot of noise. Some guards start coming
- 8 guards come walking in. They are dressed a little like the patrons of the giants toe when we first met #Marys but they now have chain mail armour on over their tunics
	- I recognize some of them from the bar
- We try to convince them we are fixing the machinery for Marys
	- all but one are convinced
	- We get some of them to start helping clear out the machinery
	- I show them my contract. 
	- We convince them to finish clearing out the rubble and say we'll report the results to #Marys 
	- One of the guards is convinced so well that he offers to get us a drink for the help. 
- We follow the guard for a drink. When we got the machinery running, it also turned on some lights
- We come to the bar. There are about 60 guards in the room.
- We grab a table and get a drink with the guard who is named Hemon Cenacchi
- We catch some chatter about the recent activities
	- They were part of the army that sacked kragma and the town
- There are 3 exits including the one we came in.
	- 1 looks like there's a spot for bedrolls
	- 1 is guarded by some drow
A fight breaks out in the bar
- We get the drow guards involved in the fight then sneak through the door
- We come across two traps
	- At the second trap which is a fire trap Fiona gets caught
- We eventually come to a door that's slightly ajar
	- There is a large room with a figure cloaked in a dark robe standing in front of a bust that looks like dwarven weapon we saw an image of
	- We also see 6 dwarven statues leading up to the final platform where the figure is
- Aeyr and I open the door stealthily 
	- Puss casts pass without a trace
	- We enter the room
# Final Battle with Marys
We enter a room and see a figure standing in front of a bust of a dwarven mech
	- Fiona and I use dimension door and teleport next to the figure and attack
	- It turns out it was an illusion and Marys steps out
	- She asks if we want to join her but we decide against it and attack instead
- Two more drow are hiding in an alcove
- I cast message and mock the drow concentrating on force wall causing them to lose concentration
- Marys throws some orbs into the air causing the 4 statues to come to life then misty steps away

starting out I am on the right side attacking the drow. 
- My spyder familiar feels like #Marys might be in another alcove on the left side. However, It looks like a simple wall to me when I look
- I attack the drow and take out one of them
- On the right side is are 2 alcoves
- Fiona launches magic missile, 2 bolts to the top left alcove and 1 bolt to the bottom left alcove
	- He hits her in the top alcove and she drops the illusion hiding the left alcoves
- sickle
	- cast 1 per long rest
		- 3d10 damage 10 ft radius around me
		- blinded within 30 ft for 3 rounds
		- plants also grow to 5 times the size
	- can use a 2nd time but it causes me half damage
	- use as ordinary weapon
- I take off towards Mary's to hit her with the sickle 2nd attack
- Harkness rides past and I hop onto the back of her and her goat as she rides past
- Mary's slaps her hand and disappears. In the process she releases a thunder damage hurting us close to her 
Mary's Does her disappearing act
- 2 of the statues start moving slowly towards the stairs
- I jump off the goat and head towards the statues
- There are 4 orbs in the vonandod 
	- These are the dwarven orbs that Marys was hunting down
	- I steal one using mage hand
- I cast identify on one of the statues
	- whatever was in the orbs went into them when it was smashed against them and that's what is controlling. These are the same type of spirit orbs that when we smashed caused the skeletons to come to life and attacked everything around them
	- They are being controlled remotely if that stops they will stop immediately
	- their vulnerability is acid
	- immune to lighting and poison 
- 2 of the statues are destroyed
- puss steals the rest of the orbs in the vonandod 
- I concentrate on attacking the 2 statues left until everyone gets to me
- A group of knights of the void show up.
	- I convince them that the statues attacked marys and we are trying to fight them off
	- the group believes me and moves to attack the statutes
	- In the process I convince some of them to toss me some healing potions
- I get half the knights of the void to attack the statue and half to search for a hidden passage because I convince them it is weird that the statues came back to life
- I get 6 potions from the group. For every 3 I take I have to make a con save and if I fail a 10 I am drunk (disadvantage on attacks) for 1 hour
	- I drink 2 of them
- puss is getting drawn back to the vonandod and puts the orbs back in then yells to fiona that he needs the last orb.
- After he yells that, Marys steps out of the statue thinking that someone has the 4th orb. she still hasn't realized we have the 5th orb
- I yell to the KofV group and convince them that Marys stepping out of the statue is an imposter stepping out of a hidden tunnel and rally them behind me as I charge towards Marys 
I get close to Marys and use the sickle to kill marys
- We convince the #knights_of_the_void  that Fiona is the new boss
- We take the 4th  and 5th orb and put it in the vonadod
- A massive amount of energy comes out of it and blows a hole through the ceiling
- We loot marys
	- whip
	- a necklace with a claw holding an orb
	- I cast identify on the necklace and there is a spirit trapped inside of it that was put their by magical sacrifice
- We worry that the spirit in the necklace might be Marys, but we need to figure out if that's true and if so how to deal with it. The last time we broke an orb it released a spirit that possessed something and attacked us.
- As we are leaving we see a side tunnel with what looks like tracks from the rest of the KoV.
	- I send the spyder down the tunnel and it sees that the army is clearing out with only the KoV left. They are all gathered around and heading up  staircase
- We go through the tunnel and come out right at #14. We notice buildings #13 and #3 are falling into the hole caused by the blast
- We head to the Inn and take a #long_rest we notice a for sale sign on the Inn
