## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log
A fight breaks out in the bar
- We get the drow guards involved in the fight then sneak through the door
- We come across two traps
	- At the second trap which is a fire trap Fiona gets caught
- We eventually come to a door that's slightly ajar
	- There is a large room with a figure cloaked in a dark robe standing in front of a bust that looks like dwarven weapon we saw an image of
	- We also see 6 dwarven statues leading up to the final platform where the figure is
- Aeyr and I open the door stealthily 
	- Puss casts pass without a trace
	- We enter the room
