## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- Fiona makes his way down to us. Only half of our rations survive
- We take a long rest
- we start foraging as we are trying to find our way out of the forest
- We continue in the direction where the rail tracks was following around the mountain
- we don't really feel like we are finding our way out
- Aery turns into a tree, then chats with the trees around us. 
	- They mention another 3 groups that have intruded on the trees. One of the groups they seem apprehensive about. the other 2 are younger and they are unsure about them.
	- The other groups are about 2 days away. 
- We decide to go and try to find the other group
- We start hearing some noise that sounds like a lite tune. we are able to follow it and head towards it.
- Puss and I sneak up. As we get close we see a rectangular clearing. At the far side we see 3 creatures 
	- rock gnome
	- goat
	- something between halfling and half elf. really fair skin almost goldish or even almost metallic sheen
- the torches are floating and the harp is playing itself
- Only the not halfling not half elf is doing the talking and it's laughing at it's own jokes
- We enter and announce ourselves. the not elf person looks friends and happily beckons us forward offering us food and drink
- Aeyr does an arcana check is all over the map. there's lots of magic going on.
- He points to the goat and introduces him as Mertc
- We introduce ourself
- He introduces himself as Fel-elicity. He seems to be moving with a limp
	- Puss asks him about the limp. he passes it off as some other group not friendly
	- he tries to pour us wine but he seems to have a hard time pouring and spills it
- He seems suspicious but we aren't really sure what's going on
- I decide to go ahead and eat some of the food.. then my eyes glaze over and I have a slunk look like the rock gnome and the goat
-
