## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

* We are camped out at the lake underground, waiting for the water to recede so that we can escape.
* after a couple of days
	* we see some rippling in the water
	* I throw a rock, we see it hit the water but there is no sound
	* We start hearing voices that are almost 
	* I tell them again about the statue again and that I can't show it them. 
	* Puss ask's if he can see it so I tell him it's in my bag and I open it, I can see the statue but puss can't
	* Aeyr senses that there is a very strong illusion magic coming from my bag.
	* I drop the bag then walk away
		* after a get about 40 ft I stop hearing the whispering but I start feeling sick and almost compelled that I need to go back to the bag
	* Fiona casts see invisiblility and he can see the invisible statue but he can't grab
	* In the darkness I am able to pull the statue out of the bag, but when I go to put it down I can't let go. Even when I go to put back in the bag I can't let go.
	* I put myself to sleep
		* Fiona shot the statue a couple of times with firebolt and it was cracked
		* when I woke up, I stabbed the stature with my dagger. Each time it hurt me just as much as it hurt the stature. eventually the damage broke however.
	* After the statue breaks we are temporaily blinded by a bright flash and then we roll intitiative
		* Right next to me is a woman on the ground who appears unconcous and dressed in fine clothes
	* Fiona yells out Hag!! and shoots magic missile
	* I stab her a little to see if hurting her still hurts me
	* when I try to get up she grabs my hand and says help me
		* I believe her
	* Fiona keeps shooting her with magic missile
	* she finally looks at all of us and says "I only require my property, (pointing to me) and then I'll let the rest of you live" then shoots fiona and knocks him out with a second magic missile 
	*
