## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

We are fighting the group and seem to be doing pretty good. We still don't know who they are but they seem to have pissed off the trees. The trees take at least one body away.
## Log

The group that steps out and we are confronting are:
- 4 drow
- 2 orc
- 2 kobolds
- 1 tiefling

Initiative order
- puss 20
- tia 17
- felicity 16
- fiona 11
- Harkness and Mer 7
- Aery and Ilk - 3

Fight continues:
- Drow 1 yells "Enough of this" and reaches into her cloak to draw out an orb.
	- we recognize the orb as the same type as what he found in the basement but instead of white it's filled with a blue smoke, which she smashes and inhales the smoke
	- We have to do a constitution save throw
		- We see a flash of a shape that looks like a dragon and are we are now scared, so all our rolls are at disadvantage and can't move towards her
- The drow blows up shouting out a lightning attack that sets the forest on fire and knocks out #Felicity. Felicity tosses ilk into a rope trick portal before getting knocked out
- We get Ilk back and load up Felicity on Mer
- We head away from the fire and head down the path the drow group came from
- The forest is more quiet than normal and we get a weird feeling
- I study the poisoned arrow some but can't figure it out
- I give Felicity some of the tree leaves. This snaps him awake.
- It's starting to snow which Felicity noticies and says is bad. Really bad.
	- The forest is somewhat sentient but it's dying now and we are in the middle of it.
- Felicity says he can probably get us out of there but we have to close our eyes and not open them it might not work
	- It works..Seems like we are flying. Then he realizes he doesn't really know where to take us.
	- He eventually says he sees a settlement so takes us down.
	- It turns out it's the goblin settlement, but it's been destroyed including the goblins and the councel of old goblins. Bodies everywhere.
	- We don't see the body of Farquad.
- The burning looks similar to what happened to the forrest
- I asked about the group... but Felicity says he's not sure if he can tell us.
- We look around and enter the Fortress to see what we can find
	- When we enter the chamber we see the bodies of the bugbear that made us fight, the half drow that we ran into on our escape and on dais we see the body of the black spyder (Merys look alike)
