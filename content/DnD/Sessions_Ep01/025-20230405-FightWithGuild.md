## Session Summary

We kill all of the guild people except for one bureaucrat who runs into the cave. We learn that the mine has been nearly exhausted, so the miners guild decided it wasn't worth rescuing the miners. It was more cost-effective for them to just blow the entrance and write off the miners, then try to save them from the goblins.

## Recap of Last Session

We gathered the rest of our shit. Then went to check out one of the mine's that had been recently attacked by goblins. We found that the goblins were still in the cave as well as around a 100 miners. The miner's guild was getting ready to blow the entrance with the miners still in there. They also mouthed off to us. We asked them to wait so we could try to take care of the goblins, there was some disagreements, and we ended up getting into a fight with them.

## Log

We killed 2 spell casters. The last 1 I try to intimidate the bureaucrats to stand down
	* there are 2 bureaucrats , 2 warrios and 2 spell casters left
	* We kill all of them, except 1 bureaucrat who runs away into the cave
	* We loot the bodies
		* 114 Gold, Letter from the guild, two longbows, some arrows, a longsword
		* The letter is official orders to come to the cave and blow the entrance, the mine has been mined nearly to exhausting. It states that if it's possible (as long as it's not too difficult) they should try to rescue the miners. However, the insurance they have on the miner's means they would come out with profits either way.
		* I chat with farquad about converting one of the longbows into a shortbow
