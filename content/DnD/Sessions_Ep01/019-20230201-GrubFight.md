## Session Summary

After encountering a group of formidable grub monsters, they managed to defeat several but inadvertently attracted the attention of the mother grub. Engaging in a tactical retreat, they sought refuge near Farquad's turret. The gigantic Mother Grub eventually appeared, forcing the party to devise a plan using minor illusion to hide. As the intense battle unfolded, the group combined their skills to attack and defend against the monstrous creature's powerful tentacles. Through clever tactics, magical abilities, and teamwork, they successfully repelled the Mother Grub, causing it to flee the area. The session was filled with thrilling combat and quick thinking as the party overcame this formidable underground threat.

## Recap of Last Session
We entered the mine. Explored it a bit, found an undergrown lake. Triggered a trap and caused a cave in. Trying to find a way out, we came across a bunch of grub monsters. We kill 3, and they start yelling out
