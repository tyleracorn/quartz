## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log

- Mary's Does her disappearing act
- 2 of the statues start moving slowly towards the stairs
- I jump off the goat and head towards the statues
- There are 4 orbs in the vonandod 
	- These are the dwarven orbs that Marys was hunting down
	- I steal one using mage hand
- I cast identify on one of the statues
	- whatever was in the orbs went into them when it was smashed against them and that's what is controlling. These are the same type of spirit orbs that when we smashed caused the skeletons to come to life and attacked everything around them
	- They are being controlled remotely if that stops they will stop immediately
	- their vulnerability is acid
	- immune to lighting and poison 
- 2 of the statues are destroyed
- puss steals the rest of the orbs in the vonandod
