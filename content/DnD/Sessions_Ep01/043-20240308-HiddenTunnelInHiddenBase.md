## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log
- We enter a room and see a figure standing in front of a bust of a dwarven mech
	- Fiona and I use dimension door and teleport next to the figure and attack
	- It turns out it was an illusion and Marys steps out
	- She asks if we want to join her but we decide against it and attack instead
- Two more drow are hiding in an alcove
- I cast message and mock the drow concentrating on force wall causing them to lose concentration
- Marys throws some orbs into the air causing the 4 statues to come to life then misty steps away.
