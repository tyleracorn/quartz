## Session Summary
Fiona and I enter a room with a dragon statue. We take our sweet ass time and finally figure out how to manuver parts of the statue to open a secret passage under the altar. That takes most of the session. We go through the passage and find a room with some stuff. Fiona puts on a cloak that makes him wreathed in shadows.

The other half of the party split from us does something

## Recap of Last Session
We enter combat with the guards and destroy them, however they are able to alert more guards before we knock them out. Aeyr Jams the door shut and holds them off. After investigating the sarcophegaous, Fiona figures out the name of the god after finding an orb in each of the sarcophegaous. Fiona rushes back to the secret door and Aeyr decides the orbs are dangerous and doesn't trust Fiona, so she smashes one, Tia follows her lead and smashes another. The third orb disapears. 

Before the guards break through the door, I chase after Fiona and we both enter the secret door. The others go through the other locked door (on the north/east end of the room) and head up the stairs opening the door.

				* There are 8 orbs which are clear (whereas as the ones before were opaque)
