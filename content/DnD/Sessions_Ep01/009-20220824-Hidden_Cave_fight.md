## Session Summary
We enter combat with the guards and destroy them, however they are able to alert more guards before we knock them out. Aeyr Jams the door shut and holds them off. After investigating the sarcophegaous, Fiona figures out the name of the god after finding an orb in each of the sarcophegaous. Fiona rushes back to the secret door and Aeyr decides the orbs are dangerous and doesn't trust Fiona, so she smashes one, Tia follows her lead and smashes another. The third orb disapears. 

Before the guards break through the door, I chase after Fiona and we both enter the secret door. The others go through the other locked door (on the north/east end of the room) and head up the stairs opening the door.

## Recap of Last Session
After saving [[DnD/World/People/Ilk]] we proceed to investigate the underground cave network. We find a hidden door that looks like it may have been there before the current occupants of the cave took over for their own nefarious dealings. The key to unlocking the door seems associated with the 3 sarcophegous that we find with a flame dragon emblem on them.  
We also find three guards at what looks to be the normal entrance to the cave, which we decide to take out. The session ends on initiation

## Log

* We Enter into combat and end up taking out the guards in short order. One gets a chance to yell out but, at the end of the combat, we don't hear any other gaurds coming.
	* The guards are huminoid and are wearing the same type of armour as above in the bar 
	* They both have a brand on their left chest that looks similar to the image on the sarchophageous
* Puss and Fiona open up one of the sarcophageous. They see a human looking skeloton holding a clear orb inside. 
	* Fiona rases the orb up with mage hand and sees 2 leters underneath it.
	* They get the second sarcophageous open when we start hearing some footsteps
* We all have different plans on how to deal with the guards
	* 1 guard comes through, Fiona hears more gaurds coming so decides to close the door behind the 1st guard
	* I kill the 1st guard
	* Fiona scares them with some lights made to look like ghost
	* I go and help open the last sarcophagous
		* I see another skeleton with a clear orb
		* I would know enough to know that this is an evil god
		* Fiona rushes back towards the hidden door
		* Aery smashes 1 orb, I smash the other orb, the 3rd orb is gone
		* The guards are smashing through the door and it's starting to splinter
		* Everyone heads through the locked door that farquad unlocked. 
		* I rush after Fiona is chanting the name of the god 3 times (Tiamat) when I round the corner
			* the hidden door turns opaque. I tell Fiona what happened in the other room. 
			* Fiona says he wants to investigate and destroy Tiamat.
			* I agree and we step through the opaque door. Fiona says Tiamat 3 times and the doors turns solid again
			* Fiona tries to signal the others that we are ok with his dancing lights.
		* The others lock the door, head up the stairs and open the door at the top of the stairs

At the end we are split into 2 partys
