## Session Summary
Fiona and I meet back up with the rest of the group in a room at the top of a tower. We loot some stuff, then head back down to the original room with the 3 sarcohpegous. We find the guards all destroyed. We surrmize that when we destroyed the 2 orbs, 2 skeletons were brought to life and killed everyone. We found the remains of 1 skeleton and heard the other one, so we ran out the passage the guards originally came down from. This lead us to what appeared to be an abandoned church with some bunk-beds. 

## Recap of Last Session
Fiona and I enter a room with a dragon statue. We take our sweet ass time and finally figure out how to manuver parts of the statue to open a secret passage under the altar. That takes most of the session. We go through the passage and find a room with some stuff. Fiona puts on a cloak that makes him wreathed in shadows.

The other half of the party split from us does something
