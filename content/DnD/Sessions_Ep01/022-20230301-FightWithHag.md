## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session
At our 4th day in the cave. Shit goes down, we break the statue, a woman comes out, Fiona yells HAG and starts blasting it. We are fighting the hag that came out of the statue/figurine that I had. It says Tia is its property and knocks out Fiona who was the main one attacking it.
## Log


- I stabalize Fiona, The hag puts me to sleep
- As people are hitting her, normal attacks don't seemt to affect her much
- Aeyr hits her with moon beam (radiant) damage and she screams in extreme pain
- farquad activates his turret and hits the hag with lightning damage
	- it hurts her
- We kill the hag there is left a
	- heart stone
	- a leather bag
- I cast identify on the leather bag
	- It's called a soul bag, it is made of human flesh, it does not currently have a soul in it.
- Farquad tries to explode the turret near the rockwall. it makes a divet but doesn't open it up
- We take a long rest
	- For the first time in a while we don't have nightmares
