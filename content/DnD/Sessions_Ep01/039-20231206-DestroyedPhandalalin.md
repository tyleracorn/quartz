## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log
- I head over to the Lord's Alliance. It looks hastily abandoned but there's a note 
	- the Note says if there are any survivors to head to the safe location in the woods. 
- I head to the Inn. As I enter, I hear some slight rustling from upstairs.
- I sneak upstairs and find #Tomlin the inn keeper hastily packing.
	- She says #Phandalin is no longer safe
	- 3 nights' past there was an alarm that the slums were on fire during the night then they were set upon by unknown assailants that were goblins, humans, hobglobins, drow, etc.
	- She explains that there is an old abandoned outpost about half a day's hike away.
	- They heard a large eruption like an earthquake and the attacking army dispersed 
	- I ask about the owners of the #spelunkin
		- Most of the survivors owe their lives to them and they are tending wounded at the outpost.
	- To reach the outpost take the road to the south past the giant's toe
- I head to the giant's toe and investigate to see if maybe the army was searching for the hidden tunnel below the bar.
	- On the way, we notice that it looks like 5 of the dwarven statues are missing.
	- It seems like the ground has been disturbed and some scorch marks on the pedestals.
	- I pull out the dwarvish hammer and the inscription is glowing
		- Harkness relates that the symbols are ancient 
	- The statues are the same as on the map that #Gundrin gave me
		- The map shows the order that orbs should be placed on the statue in order to open up a vault below.
	- We check out the miner's guild
		- We find some documents showing the loss (in deaths) that's acceptable for different mines/profit expectations
		- Talia Thornton is the president of this regions guild
		- We find 3 safes. 1 is person sized and the other 2 are about half the size
			- I cast identify. The large safe is warded with a fire-ball spell
			- 1'st small safe is stacks of documents all written in code that we can't understand.
			- 2nd small safe is filled with gold and gems
				- 190 gold and 600 silver
				- Some gems
			- Fiona got stabbed twice trying to loot the desk in the room.
			- We eventually get the door to open. trip the fireball spell which sets off explosives in the safe
	- We check out the giant's toe. we infer that maybe 
	- We are missing puss
		- Last time we saw puss was when we were studying the statues. so I go back to search for him there.
