## Session Summary

We are fighting the group and seem to be doing pretty good. We still don't know who they are but they seem to have pissed off the trees. The trees take at least one body away.

## Recap of Last Session

We all get drugged then make friends with Felicity as well as rock gnome and their goat friend/companion. After chatting and starting to get to know Felicity we are interrupted by a group that are looking for Felicity. I hide before they show up since we aren't sure who it might be. He seems like a nice enough fellow and this new group we aren't really sure about. So like usually it looks like we'll be getting into a fight with them. 
## Log

The group that steps out and we are confronting are:
- 4 drow
- 2 orc
- 2 kobolds
- 1 tiefling

Initiative order
- puss 20
- tia 17
- felicity 16
- fiona 11
- Harkness and Mer 7
- Aery and Ilk - 3

The Drow says enough and starts pulling back her bow shoots at Felicity, misses and almost hits Ilk.
We start fighting.
- I sneak up behind the drow
- one of the drow misses their shot and hits a tree...
	- aery gets the immediate feeling that the forest is pissed
- I attack from hiding getting a #surprise_attack and kill a drow
- Puss takes out 1 creature
- I get a dreadfull feeling from the trees around me.
	- I try to communicate to the trees that I'll help them take care of the people hurting them
- I kill another drow
	- afterwards vines come out of the ground and drag the drow's body into the forest
- Aery Roasts 2 goblins with moonbeam
