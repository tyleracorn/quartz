## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log
- I concentrate on attacking the 2 statues left until everyone gets to me
- A group of knights of the void show up.
	- I convince them that the statues attacked marys and we are trying to fight them off
	- the group believes me and moves to attack the statutes
	- In the process I convince some of them to toss me some healing potions
- I get half the knights of the void to attack the statue and half to search for a hidden passage because I convince them it is weird that the statues came back to life
- I get 6 potions from the group. For every 3 I take I have to make a con save and if I fail a 10 I am drunk (disadvantage on attacks) for 1 hour
	- I drink 2 of them
- puss is getting drawn back to the vonandod and puts the orbs back in then yells to fiona that he needs the last orb.
- After he yells that, Marys steps out of the statue thinking that someone has the 4th orb. she still hasn't realized we have the 5th orb
- I yell to the KofV group and convince them that Marys stepping out of the statue is an imposter stepping out of a hidden tunnel and rally them behind me as I charge towards Marys
