## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

## Log
- I don't find Puss at the status so I go check out the well and find Puss on a rope checking out the bottom of the well.
- Puss explains what he was doing
	- He was scoping it out, and he found a group of 6 hobgloblins, goblins, and drows guarding an entrance to some caves
- We had back to the inn and take a #long_rest . We then decide to head back to the well and explore the caves
- We all take the rope and work our way down the well
- we drop the goat into the water
	- the goat, and harkness are starting to drown
	- I slide now and pull them out
- we finally get everyone down and into the ledge
