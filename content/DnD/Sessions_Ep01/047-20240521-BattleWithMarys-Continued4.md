## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session

Marys comes back and I convince a group of the #knights_of_the_void that she's an imposter and lead them into a rush to go attack her
## Log

- I get close to Marys and use the sickle to kill marys
- We convince the #knights_of_the_void  that Fiona is the new boss
- We take the 4th  and 5th orb and put it in the vonadod
- A massive amount of energy comes out of it and blows a hole through the ceiling
- We loot marys
	- whip
	- a necklace with a claw holding an orb
	- I cast identify on the necklace and there is a spirit trapped inside of it that was put their by magical sacrifice
- We worry that the spirit in the necklace might be Marys, but we need to figure out if that's true and if so how to deal with it. The last time we broke an orb it released a spirit that possessed something and attacked us.
- As we are leaving we see a side tunnel with what looks like tracks from the rest of the KoV.
	- I send the spyder down the tunnel and it sees that the army is clearing out with only the KoV left. They are all gathered around and heading up  staircase
- We go through the tunnel and come out right at #14. We notice buildings #13 and #3 are falling into the hole caused by the blast
- We head to the Inn and take a #long_rest we notice a for sale sign on the Inn
