## Recap of Last Session

![](DnD/Sessions_Ep01/005-20220706-Goblin_Cave_Fight.md##^summary)

## Log

### Branthems the "Uptight Religious"
* We head to #branthems
	* it appears fairly empty
	* supply issues and they haven't arrived
	* fears it might be caused by his main competitor
	* He doesn't drink or sell any weapons

### Spelunkin the Oddities Shopt
* We then head to #spelunkin the oddities shop
	* I buy some yeast
	* We make friends 
	* We pick up some health potions
	* Make friends with #inspera 
	* She's heard of [[Cragma]] but doesn't know anything about it

### Branded Badger Blacksmith - amazing!
* Head to #branded_badger 
	* #marth_knox
	* sells me 2 daggers and a shortsword, some wire, and some caltrops that I can insert poison into
	* She is also going to make me some throwing stars that I can insert poison into as well
	* We ask about local rumors and she tells us a the #hidden_giants_toe and a little about the #knights_of_the_void which is a new gang

### Tinkering with Farquad
* Farquad and I head back to #stone_hill  and talk about tinkering traps and making poison

### Partying at the Hidden Giants Toe
NOTE: Tia and farquad not present here. but probably got a somewhat muddled story of what happened
* Everyone else heads to #hidden_giants_toe 
	* owner (half-drow), 2 main helpers and 15 other minions drinking
	* Aery get's stoned and Jedice get's wasted
	* there's a goblin musician that seemed in trouble (bloody fingers and looks like he's probably enslaved)
	* they decide they need to save the goblin musician
	* They come back to the tavern and get farquad and Me and tell us about the goblin
		* We decide we will likely head back towards the tavern late in the morning. 
		* #Short_Rest
