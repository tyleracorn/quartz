## Session Summary

## Recap of Last Session
[[DnD/Sessions_Ep01/006-20220713-phandalin]]
We do some shopping in [[Phandalin]] where we make friends with the shopkeepers of the oddities store #spelunkin .  Small group went to the #hidden_giants_toe  and decided to help save a goblin musician

## Log

### Stone Hill Inn - Planning
* We are sitting talking about how to proceed with the rescue of the golbin bard
	* #tomlin tosses a wax sealed envelope on the table where we are talking
		* Inside is a note "friends, I hope the town has been a gracious rest. I would like to see you in the morning - Sildar"
	* We take a short rest and then head towards the #hidden_giants_toe  to recon around 5am

### Hidden Giant's Toe Recon

* In the distance and up a hill we see a grand manor that looks run-down (2-3 blocks behind)
* There are abandonded buildings next to and across from the tavern. We hide in the abandonded building on the left side of the tavern
* [[DnD/Characters/Aeyr]] wild shapes into a spyder and recons in the tavern
	* She sees 6 passed out people in the main tavern room
	* She heads through the back door which turns out to be a plain bedroom
		* bed, washbasin, and hearth
	* She notices there is a well worn path into the back bedroom but she didn't find anything with her investigation

### Fiona's Annoyed rush in
* Fiona heads, Puss and Tia follow him
	* Investigating we finally find a small brick that when we push the fireplace spins around and there is a cavern behind.
	* Fiona signals to Farquad and Aery and they come in to us

### Hidden Tunnel
* Inside the hidden tunnel which is about 10 ft wide. 
	* We head down to a room with storage room. There is a room and a set of stairs heading up
	* We pick the lock on the door and enter the room
		* the goblin in chained on a platform. There is a cistern in there (clean water) and his mandolin but they are both just out of reach of the chained goblin.
		* Puss and Auery go over and try to wake up the goblin
			* The goblin freaks out cowering in the corner.... saying "you are not by mistress" and is visably scared
			* P and A try to reasure him. He calms down a little but is still nervous
			* They give him the mandolin and ask for his name [[DnD/World/People/Ilk]]
				* I come forward and pick his lock
				* We convince him to sort of trust us and we give him some food and water
