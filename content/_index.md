Hello. Welcome to my little space on the web. I am a geospatial analyst/amateur programmer. I am particularly interested in understanding and using uncertainty in spatial analysis and more general data science [... more about me](about.md)

I enjoy sharing some of my [journey](journey.md) through different random projects in spatial analysis with open datasets, data visualizaton, programming, and stats.

In addition a friend turned me onto the wonderfully interesting program [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which is started leading me down the rabit hole if digital [gardening](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/). I started down with rabbit hole by documenting the story and journey a group of friends and I are undertaking in our DnD campaing in [Scotty Doesn't Know](DnD/Outline.md).
