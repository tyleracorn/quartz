## Overview

Edelrid has some interesting testing that they did on how knots reduce the strength of a rope/slings/cord. The tables were left in German so I decided to translate the table I was interested in and copy some of the highlights of the test over here. I do howerver, highly recommend going over and reading the [full article](https://edelrid.com/int-en/knowledge/knowledge-base/strength-reduction-of-textile-materials-by-knots) if your are interested.

## Background on Why Knots Reduce Strength
Essentially, a knot reduces the strength of textile materials due to the imbalanced distribution of the load on the fibers. The knot's bend radius is a key factor and is influenced by both the knot type and the direction of the load on the knot. The fibers in bent material are compressed, meaning that some are subject to less tension than others (see Figure 1). Tension peaks occur in the material, which can break at these points when subjected to a certain load. The cross-section shape (round, rectangular) and dimensions together with the material's elongation at break affect the impact of the uneven load distribution due to the knot. A highly stretchy material can compensate for these tension peaks more so than a static material as the fibers subject to the most tension stretch, placing the load on additional fibers.

## Testing Parameters
Prior to testing, all materials were conditioned in accordance with EN 892:2012, point 5.2. To this end, they were stored for 24 hours in conditions of 23 ± 2°C and 50% relative humidity.

  
The tensile tests to obtain reference measurements with the unknotted materials were carried out at 300 mm/min. The elongation was measured visually. The knotted structures were implemented at 500 mm/min. All tensile tests were performed three times and the results were averaged. The standard deviation between the three values was between 0.2 kN and 1.8 kN.

To depict the reduction more clearly, in the case of knots on a single strand, the percentage reduction in strength was presented in comparison with the unknotted single strand. When subjected to the load, some knots did not tear but instead slipped until the loose end came through the knot. These values are marked with an *. In the case of Dyneema® in particular, knots start to slip quickly. Back-up protection to prevent complete slipping is therefore urgently required.
  
During the tests, many of the knots slipped until this was prevented. In the case of the offset overhand and double overhand bends, the slippage was stopped by a carabiner hung in the 'eyelet'. In the case of the belay station setups, it was stopped by the blown second anchor (in the case of the test, a knotted eight).

In the case of the Hardline, the sheath mainly tore and the Dyneema® core was pulled out of the knot.
  
In the case of all materials with polyamide as the outer layer, the knot only slipped partially and, if it did, then one to three times in a jerky manner. The friction of the jerkily slipping knot melted the material to such a great extent that the knot stuck together and the fabric tore.

## Discussion of the Results

Major differences were recorded in knot strength depending on the material and the type of knot. In the case of some materials or uses, the absolute strength values significantly exceed requirements, meaning it is ultimately irrelevant which knot is used and the decision can be taken based on practical usage aspects. With some combinations of material and usage, it makes sense to consider the strength reducing effect of a knot when making a selection.

## Knots On A Single Strand

Knots have the least strength reducing effect on ropes: a maximum of -43% with single strands. Knots have a particularly strong strength reducing effect on Aramid Cord (-64% on average across all knots), Hardline (-62% on average across all knots) and Dyneema® 8 mm (-54% on average across all knots). It is clear that with the remaining constructions, the presence of PA with greater elongation positively affects the strength reduction caused by knots.

  
When comparing knot types, the flat offset overhand and double flat overhand bends have the greatest strength reducing effect of -38% to -75%, with the offset overhand bend causing slightly greater strength reduction. The load type on the knot has a significant influence on the knot's strength reducing effect. If an offset overhand bend is subjected to load as a roping-up knot, the strength reduction is about 20% less than when the load is placed on the ring. The double fisherman's knot causes less strength reduction than the double flat overhand bend.
