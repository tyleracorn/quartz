Accessories:
- The catamaran and sail both look interesting. However it's heavier and a bit more complicated. I am thinking for the first build to maybe just go with the standard. 
	- Thinking about it more, the skin on frame canoes with sail/catamaran kits look really interesting... so maybe it would be worth doing two of those later on
- The brass wear strip might be good to have. will have to think about that some more. I wonder if I couldn't install it later though? looks like there are some design differences so it needs to be added during build
Coloring options
- rare earth system is the coloring type I would like to go with
