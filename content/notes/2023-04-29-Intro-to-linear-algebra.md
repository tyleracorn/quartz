# Intro to Linear Algebra

Hello! Welcome to your learning path for understanding linear algebra. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations, matrices, vector spaces, and linear transformations. It is a fundamental subject that has applications in many fields, such as computer graphics, physics, engineering, economics, and statistics.

To start learning linear algebra, I recommend the following steps:

1. Learn the basics of algebra: Before you dive into linear algebra, it's essential to have a good understanding of algebraic concepts like variables, equations, and operations. Make sure you have a solid foundation in algebra before proceeding.

2. Study matrices: Matrices are a central concept in linear algebra. You'll need to understand how to add, subtract, multiply, and invert matrices. You'll also learn about determinants, which are useful for finding inverses and solving systems of linear equations.

3. Understand vector spaces: A vector space is a set of vectors that satisfy certain properties. You'll need to know what a vector is and how to add and scale vectors. You'll also learn about linear combinations and linear independence.

4. Study linear transformations: Linear transformations are functions that preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication. You'll learn how to represent them as matrices and how to find their kernels and ranges.

5. Learn about eigenvectors and eigenvalues: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important in linear algebra because they help us understand how a matrix or linear transformation stretches or compresses vectors. You'll learn how to find them and how to use them to diagonalize matrices.

6. Apply linear algebra: Once you have a good understanding of the basic concepts, you can start applying linear algebra to solve real-world problems. You can use linear algebra to solve systems of linear equations, find the least-squares solutions to over-determined systems, analyze networks, and more.

I recommend using textbooks, online courses, or video lectures to learn linear algebra. Practice is essential, so make sure you work through lots of exercises and problems to solidify your understanding of the concepts. Good luck on your journey to understanding linear algebra!

# Matrices

Matrices are one of the fundamental concepts in linear algebra. They are rectangular arrays of numbers or variables that are arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are useful for representing and solving systems of linear equations, performing transformations, and many other applications in various fields of science and engineering.

Here are some key concepts related to matrices that you should know:

1. Matrix notation: A matrix is denoted by a capital letter, such as A or B, and its elements are denoted by a subscript notation, such as A[i,j] or B[m,n]. The size of a matrix is given by the number of rows and columns it has. For example, a matrix with m rows and n columns is said to be an m Ã— n matrix.

2. Types of matrices: Matrices can be classified based on their properties. Some common types of matrices are square matrices (when the number of rows and columns are equal), diagonal matrices (when all non-diagonal elements are zero), identity matrices (when all diagonal elements are one and all non-diagonal elements are zero), and symmetric matrices (when A = A^T, where A^T is the transpose of A).

3. Operations on matrices: Matrices can be added, subtracted, and multiplied. Addition and subtraction are done element-wise, while matrix multiplication is done using a specific rule that involves dot products of rows and columns. You can also find the inverse of a square matrix, which is useful for solving systems of linear equations.

4. Transpose: The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping it along its diagonal. The transpose of a matrix A is denoted as A^T. The transpose of a matrix can be used to define the dot product of vectors and to find the adjugate of a matrix.

5. Determinant: The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar value that provides important information about the matrix. The determinant is used to determine whether a matrix has an inverse, to compute the inverse of a matrix, and to find the area or volume of a parallelogram or parallelepiped.

6. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used to describe the behavior of a matrix or linear transformation. Eigenvectors are vectors that remain in the same direction after a matrix or transformation is applied to them. Eigenvalues are scalars that represent how much an eigenvector is stretched or compressed by a matrix or transformation.

Understanding matrices is essential to understanding linear algebra, and it forms the foundation for many advanced topics such as linear transformations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. By mastering matrices, you will be able to solve systems of linear equations, perform matrix transformations, and solve a wide range of problems in various fields.

## Why Matrix Math?

Matrix addition and multiplication are fundamental operations in linear algebra, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations, vector spaces, and linear transformations. Matrices provide a convenient way to represent and manipulate linear systems and transformations.

Here are some reasons why matrix addition and multiplication are useful:

1. Linear equations: Matrices are commonly used to represent systems of linear equations, which arise in many fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and computer science. Matrix addition and multiplication allow us to solve and manipulate these equations efficiently.

2. Linear transformations: Matrices can also represent linear transformations, which are functions that preserve the properties of linear systems such as linearity, homogeneity, and superposition. Examples of linear transformations include rotations, reflections, scaling, and shearing. Matrix multiplication allows us to compose and apply these transformations efficiently.

3. Data analysis: Matrices are widely used in data analysis and machine learning, where they represent datasets and operations such as feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Matrix addition and multiplication enable us to manipulate and transform these datasets efficiently.

4. Graphics and computer graphics: Matrices are also used extensively in computer graphics and video game programming, where they represent transformations of 3D objects and camera views. Matrix multiplication allows us to apply these transformations to the vertices and pixels of these objects efficiently.

Overall, matrix addition and multiplication are fundamental operations that are used extensively in many fields of science, engineering, and mathematics. They provide a powerful and versatile way to represent and manipulate linear systems and transformations, and are essential tools for solving problems and analyzing data.

## Adding and Subtracting

Sure! Adding and subtracting matrices is a simple process that involves adding or subtracting corresponding elements in each matrix. Here are some examples:

Example 1: Suppose we have two matrices A and B, given by:

```
A = [ 2  3 ]
    [-1  4 ]

B = [ 1 -2 ]
    [ 3  0 ]
```

To add these matrices, we simply add the corresponding elements in each matrix:

```
A + B = [ 2+1   3-2 ]
        [-1+3   4+0 ]

      = [ 3   1 ]
        [ 2   4 ]
```

To subtract these matrices, we simply subtract the corresponding elements in each matrix:

```
A - B = [ 2-1   3+2 ]
        [-1-3   4-0 ]

      = [ 1   5 ]
        [-4   4 ]
```

Example 2: Suppose we have two matrices C and D, given by:

```
C = [ 1  2  3 ]
    [ 4  5  6 ]

D = [ 0  1  2 ]
    [ 3  4  5 ]
```

To add these matrices, we simply add the corresponding elements in each matrix:

```
C + D = [ 1+0   2+1   3+2 ]
        [ 4+3   5+4   6+5 ]

      = [ 1  3  5 ]
        [ 7  9 11 ]
```

To subtract these matrices, we simply subtract the corresponding elements in each matrix:

```
C - D = [ 1-0   2-1   3-2 ]
        [ 4-3   5-4   6-5 ]

      = [ 1  1  1 ]
        [ 1  1  1 ]
```

In general, when adding or subtracting matrices, make sure that the matrices have the same dimensions. That is, they must have the same number of rows and the same number of columns.

### Matrix Addition using a real world example

Sure! Here is a real-world example of how matrix addition can be used:

Suppose you are a store manager and you have a list of the daily sales for three products over the course of a week. You can represent this data as a matrix, where the rows correspond to the days of the week and the columns correspond to the products. Here is an example of what the matrix might look like:

```
    | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 |
----|----------|----------|----------|
Mon |   100    |    75    |   120    |
Tue |    80    |   110    |    90    |
Wed |   120    |    90    |    80    |
Thu |    90    |   100    |   110    |
Fri |   110    |    80    |    70    |
Sat |    70    |   120    |   130    |
Sun |   100    |    90    |    60    |
```

Now, suppose you want to know the total sales for each day of the week. You can use matrix addition to compute the sum of each row, which gives you the total sales for each day. To do this, you simply add up the entries in each row and write the results in a new matrix. Here is the resulting matrix:

```
    | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 | Total Sales |
----|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
Mon |   100    |    75    |   120    |     295     |
Tue |    80    |   110    |    90    |     280     |
Wed |   120    |    90    |    80    |     290     |
Thu |    90    |   100    |   110    |     300     |
Fri |   110    |    80    |    70    |     260     |
Sat |    70    |   120    |   130    |     320     |
Sun |   100    |    90    |    60    |     250     |
```

As you can see, matrix addition allows you to combine the information from multiple matrices to obtain a new matrix that represents a summary of the data. In this case, we used matrix addition to compute the total sales for each day of the week, but matrix addition can be used for many other purposes as well.

## Matrix multiplication

Certainly! Multiplying matrices is a bit more involved than adding or subtracting matrices. The process involves taking dot products of the rows and columns of the matrices. Here are the steps for multiplying two matrices A and B:

1. Check the dimensions: To multiply matrices A and B, the number of columns in A must be equal to the number of rows in B. If this condition is not satisfied, the matrices cannot be multiplied.

2. Set up the product matrix: The product matrix C will have the same number of rows as A and the same number of columns as B. The elements of C will be computed as dot products of the rows of A and the columns of B.

3. Compute the dot products: To compute the elements of C, take the dot product of each row of A with each column of B. The dot product of a row and a column is obtained by multiplying corresponding elements and summing the products. The dot product of row i of A and column j of B is given by:

```
C[i,j] = A[i,1]*B[1,j] + A[i,2]*B[2,j] + ... + A[i,n]*B[n,j]
```

where n is the number of columns in A and the number of rows in B.

4. Repeat for all rows and columns: Compute the dot product for each pair of row and column indices and place the resulting value in the corresponding entry of the product matrix C.

Here's an example to illustrate how to multiply matrices:

Example: Suppose we have two matrices A and B, given by:

```
A = [ 2  3 ]
    [-1  4 ]
    [ 0  1 ]

B = [ 1 -2  0 ]
    [ 3  0  1 ]
```

To multiply these matrices, we first check that the number of columns in A (2) is equal to the number of rows in B (2). Since this condition is satisfied, we can proceed with the multiplication.

The product matrix C will have 3 rows (the same as A) and 3 columns (the same as B):

```
C = [ *  *  * ]
    [ *  *  * ]
    [ *  *  * ]
```

To compute the first element of C (the element in the first row and first column), we take the dot product of the first row of A and the first column of B:

```
C[1,1] = 2*1 + 3*3 = 11
```

To compute the second element of C (the element in the first row and second column), we take the dot product of the first row of A and the second column of B:

```
C[1,2] = 2*(-2) + 3*0 = -4
```

We repeat this process for all rows and columns:

```
C = [ 11 -4  6 ]
    [-10  8 -1 ]
    [  3  0  1 ]
```

So the product of A and B is the matrix C:

```
A*B = [ 11 -4  6 ]
      [-10  8 -1 ]
      [  3  0  1 ]
```

That's how you multiply matrices!

### Real World Example

Certainly! Here's an example of how matrix multiplication can be used in a real-world context:

Suppose you are a sales manager for a company that sells three products in four regions. You want to calculate the total revenue generated by each product in each region. You have a matrix that represents the sales of each product in each region, and you have another matrix that represents the price of each product.

Here is an example of what the sales matrix might look like:

```
    | Region 1 | Region 2 | Region 3 | Region 4 |
----|----------|----------|----------|----------|
Product 1 |   100    |    75    |   120    |    90    |
Product 2 |    80    |   110    |    90    |   100    |
Product 3 |   120    |    90    |    80    |   110    |
```

And here is an example of what the price matrix might look like:

```
    | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 |
----|----------|----------|----------|
Price |    10    |    15    |    12    |
```

To calculate the total revenue for each product in each region, you can use matrix multiplication. Specifically, you can multiply the sales matrix by the price matrix to obtain a new matrix that represents the revenue for each product in each region. Here is the resulting matrix:

```
    | Region 1 | Region 2 | Region 3 | Region 4 |
----|----------|----------|----------|----------|
Product 1 |  1000    |   1125   |   1440   |   1080   |
Product 2 |  1200    |   1650   |   1350   |   1500   |
Product 3 |  1440    |   1350   |    960   |   1320   |
```

As you can see, matrix multiplication allows you to combine information from two different matrices to obtain a new matrix that represents a summary of the data. In this case, we used matrix multiplication to calculate the total revenue for each product in each region, but matrix multiplication can be used for many other purposes as well.

## Matrix Division

Matrix division is not a well-defined operation like matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In fact, you cannot divide one matrix by another matrix directly. However, you can use matrix multiplication to solve systems of linear equations, which can be seen as a type of matrix division.

Suppose we have a system of linear equations given by:

```
a11*x1 + a12*x2 + ... + a1n*xn = b1
a21*x1 + a22*x2 + ... + a2n*xn = b2
...
am1*x1 + am2*x2 + ... + amn*xn = bm
```

We can write this system in matrix form as:

```
A * x = b
```

where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants. To solve for x, we can use matrix multiplication to isolate x:

```
A * x = b
A^-1 * A * x = A^-1 * b
x = A^-1 * b
```

where A^-1 is the inverse matrix of A. The inverse matrix A^-1 exists only if the determinant of A is not zero. If A is an n x n matrix, then its inverse matrix A^-1 is also an n x n matrix, and it is defined as:

```
A^-1 = 1/|A| * adj(A)
```

where |A| is the determinant of A, and adj(A) is the adjugate or classical adjoint of A, which is obtained by taking the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A.

So, to "divide" by a matrix, we actually need to find the inverse of the matrix, and then use matrix multiplication to solve a system of linear equations.

## What are Determinants?

In linear algebra, the determinant is a scalar value that can be associated with a square matrix. The determinant provides information about the properties of the matrix, such as its invertibility, eigenvalues, and volume scaling factor.

To calculate the determinant of a square matrix A, we use the following formula:

|A| = sum over all permutations of {1, 2, ..., n} of (sgn(p) * a1p1 * a2p2 * ... * anpn)

where n is the size of the matrix (i.e., the number of rows/columns), p is a permutation of the indices {1, 2, ..., n}, sgn(p) is the sign of the permutation (+1 for even permutations, -1 for odd permutations), and aipj is the entry of the matrix in row i and column j.

In other words, to calculate the determinant of a matrix A, we take the sum of the products of the entries of A, each weighted by the sign of the corresponding permutation of the indices. This may sound complicated, but it becomes simpler for small matrices.

For example, consider the following 2x2 matrix A:

```
a11 a12
a21 a22
```

The determinant of A is:

|A| = a11*a22 - a12*a21

For a 3x3 matrix A, the determinant is:

|A| = a11*a22*a33 + a12*a23*a31 + a13*a21*a32 - a31*a22*a13 - a32*a23*a11 - a33*a21*a12

Determinants have several important properties:

1. The determinant of a matrix A is zero if and only if A is not invertible (i.e., the matrix is singular). In this case, the system of linear equations represented by A has either no solutions or infinitely many solutions.

2. The determinant of a product of matrices is equal to the product of the determinants of the individual matrices: |AB| = |A| * |B|. This means that if either A or B has determinant zero, then AB also has determinant zero.

3. The determinant of the transpose of a matrix A is equal to the determinant of A: |A| = |A^T|. This means that the determinant is invariant under transposition.

4. Multiplying a row or column of a matrix A by a scalar c multiplies the determinant of A by c. This means that the determinant is a linear function of each row or column.

Overall, the determinant is a powerful tool for analyzing the properties of square matrices and solving systems of linear equations. It has many applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.

### Explanation for Invertible

An invertible matrix is a square matrix that has an inverse matrix. The inverse matrix of a square matrix A is denoted by A^(-1) and has the property that A * A^(-1) = A^(-1) * A = I, where I is the identity matrix.

In other words, if a matrix A is invertible, we can multiply it by its inverse matrix A^(-1) to get the identity matrix I. The inverse matrix can be seen as a "reverse" operation to the original matrix, and allows us to "undo" the effects of A.

A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero. This means that if the determinant of a matrix is zero, the matrix is not invertible and is said to be singular. In this case, the system of linear equations represented by the matrix has either no solutions or infinitely many solutions.

The inverse of a matrix can be calculated using the following formula:

A^(-1) = (1/|A|) * adj(A)

where |A| is the determinant of A, and adj(A) is the adjugate matrix of A, which is obtained by taking the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A.

The inverse matrix is useful in many applications, such as solving systems of linear equations, finding the solution to least-squares problems, and computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues of matrices. It is also used in computer graphics and video game programming, where it is used to transform objects and camera views.

Overall, invertible matrices are important in linear algebra and have many practical applications. The invertibility of a matrix is closely related to its determinant, and understanding the properties of these matrices is essential for solving problems in linear algebra and related fields.


### Explanation for Invariant

Sure! In mathematics, an invariant is a property or quantity of an object that does not change under certain transformations or operations. In other words, an invariant is something that remains the same even after a change or transformation has been applied.

For example, the determinant of a matrix is an invariant under transposition. This means that if we take the transpose of a matrix, the determinant of the resulting matrix is the same as the determinant of the original matrix. Similarly, the eigenvalues of a matrix are invariant under similarity transformations, which means that if we multiply a matrix by a nonsingular matrix, the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix are the same as the eigenvalues of the original matrix.

Invariants are useful in many areas of mathematics and physics, because they allow us to simplify problems and classify objects based on their properties. For example, in algebraic geometry, the concept of an invariant is used to study the geometric properties of curves and surfaces. In physics, the concept of an invariant is used to describe the laws of nature that remain the same under different reference frames.

Overall, invariants are an important concept in mathematics and science, because they allow us to identify and analyze properties that remain unchanged under different transformations or operations.
