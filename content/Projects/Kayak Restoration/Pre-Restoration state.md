17 1/2 ft stitch and glue kayak. The joints where fiberglass taped but it doesn't look like there was fiberglass anywhere else. It was coated with what I assume is an epoxy coat and then painted. There has been a repair job done in the bottom of the cockpit. A thin sheets of something was coming up. Maybe epoxy that didn't bond well? It didn't look like fiberglass. I could try to sand it down some and apply a sheet of fiberglass to add some extra strength.

I tried to sand and strip the paint. I've gotten down to mostly the plyewood and now I want to refinish it. During the sanding/stripping I learned a lot but there a definitely took it to far and now there are quite a few divits, so I probably need to do some base filler first. I'll probably finish with some sort of paint or epoxy pigment. 

One main question I have is if it is worth it that much to apply a fiberglass layer on the outside or apply epoxy and call it good. Use case is mostly lakes around here. Some rocky shores but not a lot of danger of crashing into things.
