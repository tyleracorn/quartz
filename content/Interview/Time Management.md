## Managing multiple tasks (dependent)

### Completing a new mineral resource estimate

1) Break down the project into logical groups (data collection, data prep/cleanup, Data exploration, QAQC, modeling project extents, prepping data for MRE, Completing the MRE, Model checks/QAQC, report writeup)
2) Determine how each step is connected to others. Main points of concern is what steps are independant, what steps have follow other steps.
4) Create a general timeline. Often by starting with the deadline and working backwords
5) Evaluate key point where we can check back into the timeline to determine if there is slippage, or timelines can compress etc.

## Managing Multiple Tasks: 

### Completing Multiple MREs Simultaneously

- **Situation:**
    - Two Mineral Resource Estimates (MREs) needed completion simultaneously.
    - One had a hard deadline (external funding), while the other had a soft, internal deadline.
- **Task:**
    - Manage both projects efficiently, ensuring the first met its strict deadline without compromising overall quality.
- **Actions:**
    1. Created project timelines by collaborating with clients to confirm deadlines (hard vs. soft).
    2. Identified critical milestones where delays could jeopardize deadlines.
    3. Regularly communicated progress updates to clients.
    4. Addressed unforeseen delays in modeling work by:
        - Prioritizing the hard-deadline project.
        - Reassigning resources to accelerate completion.
        - Notifying the soft-deadline client of potential delays.
- **Result:**
    - Delivered the first project on time, meeting the clientâ€™s critical funding deadline.
    - Completed the second project slightly late, but the client accepted the revised timeline.
