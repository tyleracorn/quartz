They have a strong sense of honor and most often will chose to do what they believe they should do \"damn the consequences\". This has lead to a cyclical rise and fall in the clans numbers. Although they don't broadcast their intentions, they don't try to actively hide the fact that they have, since the begining of their foundation, been searching for a specific \"god\" they have vowed to find and kill. This god is fairly secretive and little is known of them other then their name \"Skadi\"\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-17T05:21:10.185314126Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Missions/Find-Gundrin":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-11-17T05:21:10.185314126Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Missions/Forge-of-Spells":{"title":"","content":"\nA magical forge.

I left Newmont and completed a M.Sc. at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB, CA) where I studied geospatial analysis at the [Centre for Computational Geostatistics](http://www.ccgalberta.com/) My research and post-graduate work has focused on my interest in understanding and using uncertainty in a geospatial analysis framework. In addition to my research, I worked with three other members of the research group to develop the python package [PyGeostat](http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/welcome.html) to manage geostatistical workflows and to provide data visualization for geostatistics in a python environment.\n\n## Geospatial Analysis\n\nWorking at the University of Alberta in the [Centre for Computational Geostatistics](http://www.ccgalberta.com/) provided me with an amazing opportunity to gain a practical and theoretical background in geospatial analysis. There are many exciting areas of research that are taking place in the CCG, all with expanding our knowledge on how to deal with spatial modeling of multiple variables to correctly account for and manage the uncertainty that is inherent in geologic data.\n\n## Programming\n\nAs a self-taught programmer, my experience has been in developing within Python and Fortran. Most of my Python experience comes from developing (jointly with primarily 3 other student researchers) the geostatistical package [PyGeostat](http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/welcome.html). Fortran gets me a lot of raised eyebrows. Yes fortran is still used today! albeit barely and almost exclusively in a academic/scientific programming setting. My thesis was based around developing an algorithm in Fortran for optimizing concurrently over many models to take into account uncertainty, all within the Mining/Geostatistical/Decision Making frameworks. I have since continued learning as a hobbyist to further expand my knowledge in programming and development. Some of my public repositories are viewable on [github](https://github.com/tyleracorn/)\n\n## Engineering\n\nAs an Engineer with over 6 years of experience in the day to day operations of a major gold mine I developed myself both technically and as a leader. I am technically strong enough to help push projects through, yet with my calm and friendly nature I bring groups together into a well-rounded team to ensure goals are set and either achieved or exceeded.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-17T05:21:10.189314138Z","tags":null},"/journey":{"title":"Journey","content":"Listing of my github projects.\n\n\n## Yeg Census Neighbourhoods\n[yeg_census_neighbourhoods](portfolio/yeg_census_neighbourhoods.md) is a project where I looke at the 2016 census data for Edmonton neighborhoods to try to glean insights into the economic distribution of YEG residents.

If you are like me and are a self taught programmer/coder/data scientist... you are probably pretty comfortable with loops. We all know that loops are \"horribly slow\" and that you \"should never use\" them... blah blah blah.... However, for many of us, they are our default approach for a quick and dirt \"first draft.\" What I want to talk about in this post are hashtables.\n\n## Hash tables\n\nSo what are hash tables? They are an unorderd collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique. In python, think of a dictionary, or you could think of a one-dimensional array where your key is the index, but you are not constrained to an integer based index.\n\nIf have done any programming in python, you probably know about the dictionary. But have you considered using it like an array? Lets look at an example. I'll code it up the \"quick and dirty loop-de-loop\" way and then compare it to using a hash table.\n\n## Example\n\nHere's the example. Write up a function that takes as input two arguments. Arg1 is a list (or 1D array) of integers. Arg2 is a single integer. If any two separate values in your list add up to equal the Arg2 integer, return True. Otherwise return False.\n\nfirst we'll look at the quick and dirty approach.\n\n```python\ndef compare_int_long(intList, testInt):\n    \"\"\"\n    compare a list of integers to a single integer.\n\n    return true if any 2 integers (i1 + i2) == testInt\n    false otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    for idx1 in range(len(intList)):        # loop through the list\n        int1 = intList[idx1]                # grab current integer\n        for idx2 in range(len(intList)):    # loop through the list again\n            if idx2 != idx1:\n                int2 = intList[idx2]        # compare to every other integer\n                if int1 + int2 == testInt:\n                    return True             # passed test, so return true\n    return False                            # failed so return false\n```\n\nThis approach works, but is very brute force. For every element in your list, you compare it to every other element in your list to see if it passes the test. The problem with this approach? It scales pretty bad. This, I believe, is an *O(N\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)* complex code. This means the performance of this function increases proportionally to the square of the size of the input list.\n\nNow lets look at an example where we use the hash table (or a dictionary in python). first off though, there are a few things to note. If you create a standard dictionary in python and you call it with an undefined key... you'll raise an error. For example\n\n```python\ntemp_dict = {'a': 1, 'b':2}\ntemp_dict['c']  # raises an error\n```\n\nDefaultdict, however has an interesting property. If you pass it a key with no value, it will assign a default value to that key. So with the above example we can modify it:\n\n```python\ntemp_dict = defaultdict({'a': 1, 'b':2}, bool)\ntemp_dict['c']  # returns False\n```\n\ndefaultdict makes the above problem much easier to tackle. You could set up a try block to catch any raised errors... or use default dict as shown here.\n\nThe other thing to note, is that we need to rethink how we structure the problem. Instead of comparing each integer to every other integer (which is an *O(N\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)* performance problem), we consider a different approach. Our first test was `int1 + int2 == testInt`. However, we can rearrange the problem to `int2 == testInt - int1`. This is important because this allows us to do two separate loops through the list instead of a nested loop. Let's look at the example.\n\n```python\ndef compare_int_hash(intList, testInt):\n    \"\"\"\n    compare a list of integers to a single integer.\n\n    return true if any 2 integers (i1 + i2) == testInt\n    false otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    intHash = defaultdict(bool)             # default value will be False\n    intCount = defaultdict(int)             # default value will be 0 which is usefull for counting\n    listLength = len(intList)\n\n    for idx in range(listLength):           # 1st loop creating a hash table with the key being testInt - int1 and the value being True\n        val = testInt - intList[idx]\n        intHash[val] = True\n        intCount[val] += 1                  # count how many times\n    for idx in range(listLength):           # 2nd loop seeing if int2 is found in the hashtable\n        if intHash[intList[idx]]:\n            if intCount[intList[idx]] \u003e 1:  # do a quick check against the count so we know if we there are 2 values or if we just happen to have a single value that's half the testInt\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\nThe above example is probably more like a *O(2N)* scale problem. So, now lets take a quick look at the performance of these two functions.\n\n![Loopy-De-Loop vs Hashing](/notes/images/loop_vs_hash.png)\n\nAs you can see, the loopy-de-loop version very very quickly scales out of control. With just a list of 10,000 elements, worst case scenario, it'll take you roughly 53 seconds to test. However by using the hash table with the value you are wanting as the index key, you can test that same 10,000 element list in under a second (~0.01 s). Now just because it's dramatically different doesn't mean it's not scaling. There is an issue of scale here.\n\n![Hash scale](/notes/images/hash_scale.png)\n\nYou can see that the hash table approach is still scaling. It's just more more of a linear increase instead of the exponential scaling of the nested loop.\n\nIf you want to play around with the above code, you can check out an example notebook here: [Ex_hashtables.ipynb](https://github.com/tyleracorn/lessons/blob/master/Ex_Hashtables.ipynb)\n\nOr, open up my lessons repo on my binder and navigate to the `Ex_hashtables.ipynb` file in myBinder's interactive environment\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tyleracorn/lessons/master)\n\nHope you enjoyed this quick example!\n\n## Further Resources\n\nIf you want some further resources or even just have things explained another way, here are a few resources I found useful.\n\n* Algorithms online textbook.

I find a lot of people new to data science, geostatistics, etc. are usually familiar and comfortable with histograms, however there is a lot to learn from CDF's which is why I tend to rely on them more. This series will cover the following topics\n\n1. What are they?\n    - Explain what a Histogram and CDF is\n    - Show what info we can easily read from each graph type\n\n2. When should we use them?\n    - What are the pro's and con's of these graphical representations.\n\n## TL:DR\n\nAt their heart, both the histogram and the CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) are displaying similar information, but in different ways. A histogram can be thought of as an empirical estimation of the Probability Density Function (PDF) and represents the probability with areas. Technically the PDF would represent this with an \"area under the curve\". Histograms are bar plots... so I guess we can say they represent this with the area of a bar! The CDF represents probability with vertical distances and is cumulative.\n\n### Note: Example Data\n\nThe main plots for this post are all based on the same randomly generated distribution of numbers created using Numpy's random number generator in Python. To keep it to something most people are familiar with, the distribution is based on a normal distribution. I'm using a small number of data so my distribution is not \"perfect\" but much more realistic. If you want to see how I do this you can check out my example notebook [ex_histograms_and_cdfs](https://github.com/tyleracorn/lessons/blob/master/Ex_histograms_and_CDFs.ipynb) which shows all of the plots used in this post.\n\n## What's a Histogram\n\nHistograms are one commonly used graphical representation of a distribution of numbers. They are typically plotted in a bar graph style plot where the height of each bar shows the frequency of a bin and represents the probability that a number will fall within that bin. This is in essence a slice of the area under a curve. The width of the bar represents the bin size used to group the numbers (or the width of the slice). The total width of all bars shows the range of values in the distribution. Here's an example showing the histogram and the estimated PDF for my normal distribution:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/quartz/notes/images/2020/normal_histogram_pdf.png\" style=\"max-width:300px\" width=\"100%\" alt='histogram_pdf'\u003e\n\nAs a quick side note: Many histogram plotting functions/programs out there by default plot a histogram with 'Frequency' on the y-axis. I don't find this vary useful because the frequency doesn't really mean anything without also knowing the how many samples are in your distribution. If you have a count of 30 samples in a bin and your sample size is 50 then that means something totally different than if you have a sample size of 10,000. Using the 'Density' option in numpy/matplotlib/plotly or whatever program you are using will convert it over to a probability value which I find way more useful. Here's a quick example showing the density plot versus the frequency plot.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/quartz/notes/images/2020/normal_histogram_density_compare.png\" style=\"max-width:600px\" width=\"100%\" alt='histogram_density_vs_frequency'\u003e\n\n## What's a CDF\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (aka. CDF) is another graphical representation of the distribution of numbers (discrete, or continuous). The y-axis represents the cumulative probability, aka the percentile of your distribution. The x-axis is the values in your distribution (ordered from least to greatest). The line is using vertical distances to show the probabilities. Here's an example of the same normal distribution.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/quartz//notes/images/2020/normal_cdf.png\" style=\"max-width:300px\" width=\"100%\" alt='cdf'\u003e\n\nThe CDF also works quite well for categorical distributions. Just be mindful of how the categories are related (ordinal or nominal). Here's an example of the same normal distribution converted into a categorical distribution by converting all values to integers:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/quartz//notes/images/2020/normal_int_cdf.png\" style=\"max-width:300px\" width=\"100%\" alt='categorical cdf'\u003e\n\n## How do we read a Histograms\n\nOk so you probably already knew what a histogram was, and you might already know how to read a histogram, but to make sure we are on the same page lets look at what the histogram shows us. We'll take the same normal distribution and plot it's histogram, but this time in an interactive plot so you can look at some of the values yourself.\n\n{% include posts_images/2020/2020-04-normal_histogram_pdf.html %}\n\nFirst there are a some general pieces of information we can see from the plot without plotting any annotation. These are the range of values, probability of a value within a bin, the general shape of the distribution, the skewness of the distribution, and possible outliers. So lets look at those with the above plot:\n\n| Range of values | 6.39 to 22.42 |\n| Probability of value in 4th bin | ~6% |\n| Shape of the distribution | Typical normal \"bell curve\" |\n| Skewness | None |\n| Outliers | None |\n\nIn the above table, we did say there wasn't any skewness. How do we know that? Well some of it is based on our own loosy-goosy feeling of what the shape looks like. The other way we can get a quick sense is to also plot the mean and median lines and see if they \"look\" close together. Which brings up another interesting point. You can't really tell what the mean or median of your distribution is without plotting them. It's a non-trivial probablem to add up in our heads the probabilities of all the different bins and figure out which bin lies in the middle. Here it might look easy because we are dealing with a normal distribution. In Part 2, we'll look at a bunch of different distributions, such as the log normal distribution, and you can see how hard it is to actually tell intuitively where your median value is.\n\n## How do we read a CDF's\n\nNow that we know what a CDF is, lets start looking at what sort of information one can glean from this graph. This time we'll plot up the CDF in an interactive plot. So go ahead and play around with it some!\n\n{% include posts_images/2020/2020-04-normal_cdf.html %}\n\nWhat are the general pieces of information we can see? The range of values, Percentiles (i.e. P20 is where 20% of the values are less than or equal to that value), Your median (because the median is the P50), anything related to the percentiles (i.e. what values are between the P20 and the P80, or what values lie within +/- 20% of the median). So looking at the above cdf to find the percentile we find the decimal percentile value on the Y axis (P20 = 0.2) drew a line horizontally over to our cdf line and then go straight down, that's the percentile of our distribution. So let's look at some of those values for the above plot:\n\n| P20 | 11.6 |\n| Median (P50) | 14.4 |\n| Values between P20 - P80 | 11.6 to 17.2 |\n| Probability of values between 11.6 and 17.2 | 80% - 20% = 60% |\n\nWhat about the slope of the line? The slope of the line along the CDF also gives us some basic information. This in affect tells us how spread out values are. A steeper slope means that the there is less spread and a shallower slope gives shows a greater relative spread in your data. So if we have a relatively shallow slope at the top or bottom that could be an indication of possible outliers. Also if there is a relatively shallow slope somewhere in the middle of the distribution, that could be a sign of a bimodal distribution.\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully you have a little bit better understanding of what Histogram's and CDF's can show you about your distribution. If you want to get a quick snapshot of your distribution to see what type of distribution you might be dealing with, a histogram is your best bet. But if you want to get a better grasp of the complexities of your distribution and what you are actually dealing with, I find myself flipping back and forth a lot between both the histogram and the CDF. Stay tuned for part 2 where I will show you a bit about some of the pros and cons of using both the histogram and CDF and why, even though I realy more heavily on the CDF myself, I so often find myself flipping back and forth between both of them.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-17T05:21:10.189314138Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022-08-01-strength-reduction-knots":{"title":"Strength Reduction of Knots - Edelrid Test","content":"## Overview\n\nEdelrid has some interesting testing that they did on how knots reduce the strength of a rope/slings/cord. The tables were left in German so I decided to translate the table I was interested in and copy some of the highlights of the test over here. I do howerver, highly recommend going over and reading the [full article](https://edelrid.com/int-en/knowledge/knowledge-base/strength-reduction-of-textile-materials-by-knots) if your are interested.\n\n## Background on Why Knots Reduce Strength\nEssentially, a knot reduces the strength of textile materials due to the imbalanced distribution of the load on the fibers. The knot's bend radius is a key factor and is influenced by both the knot type and the direction of the load on the knot. The fibers in bent material are compressed, meaning that some are subject to less tension than others (see Figure 1). Tension peaks occur in the material, which can break at these points when subjected to a certain load. The cross-section shape (round, rectangular) and dimensions together with the material's elongation at break affect the impact of the uneven load distribution due to the knot. A highly stretchy material can compensate for these tension peaks more so than a static material as the fibers subject to the most tension stretch, placing the load on additional fibers.\n\n![Figure1 How Fibers break](/notes/images/2022/ED_Blog-bild-1_knoten.jpg)\n_Figure 1: fibers subject to even tension in an unknotted rope; fibers subject to uneven tension at the knot's bend radius; these areas of peak tension are then the predetermined breaking point:_\n\n## Testing Parameters\nPrior to testing, all materials were conditioned in accordance with EN 892:2012, point 5.2. To this end, they were stored for 24 hours in conditions of 23 ± 2°C and 50% relative humidity.\n\n  \nThe tensile tests to obtain reference measurements with the unknotted materials were carried out at 300 mm/min. The elongation was measured visually. The knotted structures were implemented at 500 mm/min. All tensile tests were performed three times and the results were averaged. The standard deviation between the three values was between 0.2 kN and 1.8 kN.\n\nTo depict the reduction more clearly, in the case of knots on a single strand, the percentage reduction in strength was presented in comparison with the unknotted single strand. When subjected to the load, some knots did not tear but instead slipped until the loose end came through the knot. These values are marked with an *. In the case of Dyneema® in particular, knots start to slip quickly. Back-up protection to prevent complete slipping is therefore urgently required.\n  \nDuring the tests, many of the knots slipped until this was prevented. In the case of the offset overhand and double overhand bends, the slippage was stopped by a carabiner hung in the 'eyelet'. In the case of the belay station setups, it was stopped by the blown second anchor (in the case of the test, a knotted eight).\n\nIn the case of the Hardline, the sheath mainly tore and the Dyneema® core was pulled out of the knot.\n  \nIn the case of all materials with polyamide as the outer layer, the knot only slipped partially and, if it did, then one to three times in a jerky manner. The friction of the jerkily slipping knot melted the material to such a great extent that the knot stuck together and the fabric tore.\n\n## Discussion of the Results\n\nMajor differences were recorded in knot strength depending on the material and the type of knot. In the case of some materials or uses, the absolute strength values significantly exceed requirements, meaning it is ultimately irrelevant which knot is used and the decision can be taken based on practical usage aspects. With some combinations of material and usage, it makes sense to consider the strength reducing effect of a knot when making a selection.\n\n## Knots On A Single Strand\n\nKnots have the least strength reducing effect on ropes: a maximum of -43% with single strands. Knots have a particularly strong strength reducing effect on Aramid Cord (-64% on average across all knots), Hardline (-62% on average across all knots) and Dyneema® 8 mm (-54% on average across all knots). It is clear that with the remaining constructions, the presence of PA with greater elongation positively affects the strength reduction caused by knots.\n\n  \nWhen comparing knot types, the flat offset overhand and double flat overhand bends have the greatest strength reducing effect of -38% to -75%, with the offset overhand bend causing slightly greater strength reduction. The load type on the knot has a significant influence on the knot's strength reducing effect. If an offset overhand bend is subjected to load as a roping-up knot, the strength reduction is about 20% less than when the load is placed on the ring. The double fisherman's knot causes less strength reduction than the double flat overhand bend.\n\nThe Table below is an english translation of the Edelrid table.

As an example here is a heat map generated from the included dataset.\n\n![Prediction Heat Map](assets/images/predictionHeatMap_projectBoundary.png \"Prediction Heat Map\")\n\n### Example\n\nAn example.ipynb is included in the repo to demostate how to use the package.\n\n### Dataset\nthe included dataset is from the `British Columbia Geological Survey \u003chttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/british-columbia-geological-survey\u003e`.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-17T05:21:10.273314381Z","tags":null},"/portfolio/pygeostat":{"title":"pygeostat","content":"pygeostat is a Python 3.6 module for geostatistical modeling. pygeostat is aimed at preparing spatial data, scripting geostatistical workflows, modeling using tools developed at the Centre for Computational Geostatistics, and constructing visualizations to communicate spatial data.\n\n## Features:\n\n* Configurations of persistent project parameters and plotting style parameters\n* Data file management functions for interacting with CSV, GeoEAS (GSLIB), and VTK formats\n* Utilities for managing GSLIB-style grid definitions\n* Export gridded and point data files for visualization with Paraview (VTK format)\n* Simplified scripting of gslib programs with parallelization and crash detection/notification\n* Linear desurveying and compositing methods including automatic composite detection\n* Fast, accurate variogram calculation, model fitting and modeling routines\n* Vast library of plotting functions\n\nIf you are interested for now you can head over to the [pygeostat homepage](http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/).

However, as with any data visualization project, I had to learn about the data itself and make some assumptions. So first here are the map \"goals\"\n\n* does a neighbourhood have a larger percentage of low income households or a larger percentage of middle class households\n* what is the distribution for each neighbourhood of low income, middle class, and high income households\n\nThe first major assumption made in preparing the data for visualization was what categorizes a household as either \"low income\", \"middle class\", or \"high income\". To be considered middle class it seems like you need to make above the median income for your area [\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/money-economy/are-you-in-the-middle-class/). In Edmonton that equates to an income of $70,080 (before tax) or $61,330 (after tax)[\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110001501\u0026pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.35). A better and more detailed analyses is by using the [Low Income Measure After Tax](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75f0002m/75f0002m2018002-eng.htm). However the census data source I am using for this basic project doesn't include enough data to calculate the LIM-AT. So for this project the $60K is the entry point into the \"middle class\" category. That is based on the income categories available in the data source.\n\nThe upper range of middle class is less well defined. Looking at the household income for all of Edmonton we can see the following breakdown of values\n\n* Less than $30K (16.1%)\n* Less than $60K (40.9%)\n* Less than $100K (66.7%)\n* Less than $125K (78.7%)\n* Less than $150K (86.3%)\n* Less than $200K (93.7%)\n* Less than $250K (96.8%)\n* More than $250K (3.8%)\n\nFor the purpose of this project the \"high income\" is meant to show the top 20% of the households by income which equates to the $150K break point.\n\n## Code Features and Improvements\n\n### Neighbourhood Selection Option\n\n- [x] use dc.selectionMenue to select a neighbourhood to highlight\n- [ ] remove the default \"select all\" option since that doesn't make sense with this type of data\n\n### Pie Chart showing the breakdown of Household income brackets\n\n- [x] show the percentage of households in each income bracket\n- [x] mouseover shows the bracket and percentage\n- [x] format the values in the legend and mouseover to show percentage instead of the decimal format the data is saved as\n- [x] format the income bracket name. The \"easy\" way would be to change it in the .csv file (this is the approach I ended up going with)... but I am interested in seeing if I can figure out how to do it via code. If this was python I would use a dictionary\n\n### Map of Edmonton Neighborhoods\n\n- [x] display a clickable, zoomable, draggable map using OpenStreetMap\n- [x] color the neighbourhoods based on whether there are more \"low income\" households or \"middle class\" households in that neighbourhood.\n- [x] on click display a popup with the neighbourhood name and the boolean integer value for \u003elow income (1) or \u003emiddle class (0)\n- [x] create a custom legend so it tells you which color is  \u003elow income VS \u003emiddle class.\n\n## Sources\n\nThe census data comes from the city of Edmonton open data portal\n\n[YEG 2016 Census by household income](https://data.edmonton.ca/Census/2016-Census-Population-by-Household-Income-Neighbo/jkjx-2hix)\n\n\u003c!--[YEG 2016 Census Population by Age Range](https://data.edmonton.ca/Census/2016-Census-Population-by-Age-Range-Neighbourhood-/phd4-y42v)--\u003e\n\n[YEG neighbourhood boundaries](https://data.edmonton.ca/Geospatial-Boundaries/City-of-Edmonton-Neighbourhood-Boundaries/jfvj-x253)\n\n[1: Are you in the Middle Class?](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/money-economy/are-you-in-the-middle-class/)\n\n[2: Before-tax and after-tax low income status (census family LIM) by family type and family composition](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110001501\u0026pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.35)\n\n[Low Income Measure After Tax](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75f0002m/75f0002m2018002-eng.htm)\n\n## Acknowlegdments\n\nI've been wanting to do a project like this for awhile but wasn't sure where to start until I came across [Mikel Otis ByLaw Infractions Dashboard I](https://github.com/Edmonton-Open-Data/Edmonton-Bylaw-Infractions-I/blob/master/README.md#bylaw-infractions-dashboard-i). I ran into Michael Otis at Startup Edmonton and saw some his dashboards online where he has been playing around with some of Edmonton's Open Data. I stole heavily from his code/work as a starting point to figure this all out since I don't know JS. I'm pretty much a python guy! If you want to check out some of Mikel's other stuff then head over to his github page.
