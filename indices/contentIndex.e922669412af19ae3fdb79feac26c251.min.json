She and her team have to spend lots of time taking records, querying for information, and maintaining the data. She decided to turn to you, for a Relational Database Management System.\n\nPetsCare wants to record information about customers, pets, staff, visits. Claire will be available to meet via Zoom tomorrow to discuss details. You should prepare questions for building the DBMS.\n\n## What Questions Do you Ask\n\nExplain to me the general information are keeping track of? Do you only care about patient/pet medical records or do you need to keep track of medical inventory? What's the basic information you want to keep (i.e. patient info) and what are some stretch goals for info that would be nice to have? Such as drug interactions, drug/supply inventory?\n\nCan you take the time to walk through an example patient/pet record and we can talk through the information you currently track and how that information might relate to other information you track?\n\nCoursera \"Answer\"\n\nYou should prepare two categories of questions:\n\n1. The interest of the business, what information should be recorded, what might be the entities for holding the information, what might be used as identities, etc.\n    \n2. The relationship of the entities, especially the mandatory/optional participation, and the cardinalities.

It is used to merge data from two tables when they have a common foreign key. the column name for the foriegn key doesn't need to be the same but it needs to be the same datatype\n\n#inner_join join two tables where the foreign keys from both tables match\n\nwhen you have the same column name in multiple tables you need to tell SQL which table to grab the column from, otherwise it's ambigous. To tell SQL you prefix the column with the table name seperated by a period. example - employee.employeid\n\nwhen you are referencing the tables you can create an alias for the duration of the querry if you want to save on typing\n\n#inner_join has two types. implicit and explicit. Implicit is where you say select .. from.. where fk1 = fk2. In this case the join is implied. The explicit inner join uses the Join.. on clause\n#inner_join #implicit example\nSelect LastName, Firstname, count(OrderID)\n\tfrom employees, orders\n\t where employees.employeeid = orders.employeeid\n\t Group By LastName, FirstName\n\t Order By 3 desc;\n#inner_join #explicit example\nSelect LastName, Firstname, count(OrderID)\n\tfrom employees Join orders\n\t on employees.employeeid = orders.employesidd\n\t Group By LastName, FirstName\n\t Order By 3 desc;\nFor #inner_join  #explicit and #implicit  are the same\n\nIt's possible to link up joins if you need to join data from multiple tables.\n#join_linked Example:\nSELECT LastName, Firstname, sum(unitprice * quantity) as \"Total Sales\"\n\tFROM employees E\n\t\tJOIN\n\t\t orders O ON E.employeeid = O.employeeid\n\t\t\t Join\n\t\t\t orderdetails D ON O.orderid = D.orderid\nGROUP By LastName, Firstname\nOrder by 3 desc, LIMIT 5;\n\n#cartesian_product is an problem that is easy to make. This occurs when the SQL JOIN creates a product of two tables (i.e. all columns and rows from both tables) before subsetting the tables by the columns you need. This is called an #unqualified_join which occues when you don't fully qualify the JOIN operation witha JOIN/WHERE clause that matches all necessary keys for your answer.\n\n#cartesian_product Example:\nSelect LastName, Firstname, sum(unitprice * quantity) as \"Total Sales\"\n\tFROM employees E, Orders O, orderdetails D\n\t WHERE E.employeeid = O.employeeid\nGROUP BY LastName, Firstname\n\nnote: the above statement is joining three tables but there is only One JOIN/WHERE condition\n\n#cartesian_product example fixed\nSelect LastName, Firstname, sum(unitprice * quantity) as \"Total Sales\"\n\tFROM employees E, Orders O, orderdetails D\n\t WHERE E.employeeid = O.employeeid\n\t\t and O.orderid = D.orderid\nGROUP BY LastName, Firstname\n\n#cartesian_product to fix you need 1 less join condition for the number of tables you are joining. SO if you are joining 3 tables you need 2 join conditions, etc.\n\n#outer_join this is where it will join all the rows where the keys match plus all the rows from one or the other table. So a #left_outer_join will join all rows where the keys match plus all the rows from the left table even if the keys don't match.\n#outer_join uses the LEFT OUTER JOIN or the RIGHT OUTER JOIN in postgres\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.520455683Z","tags":null},"/Classes/SQL-Intro/Module3_Grouping":{"title":"","content":"\nQueries can create an interim or final answer set. When the query (usualy a SELECT, or SELECT/WHERE) creates an interim answer set you can do some post processing such as the group functions to do things like get totals, sub totals etc.\n\nNOTE: When and how does the WHERE clause and the GROUP function work? The WHERE clause works on the first set of your query and is what creates the subset of data that goes into the interim answer set.\nThe GROUP function happens AFTER the where and operates on the subset of data\n\nGROUP functions:\n- SUM - Numeric Only\n- AVG - Numeric Only\n- COUNT - Any Type\n- MIN - Any Type\n- MAX - Any Type\n- NOTE - These work on the Non-Null values only\n\nRule to keep in mind when using group functions\n**The level of the group function you are doing must match the level of detail in your select statement**\n\nexample\nSelect OrderID, Sum(UnitPrice) as 'Total Price'\nwhere OrderID in (10248, 10249)\n\nThis would fail because we are keeping OrderID in the final table and there are multiple oderid's in there... the Sum over all UnitPrice isn't at the same detail. We would either need to drop the OrderID from the select statement (I think) or do a Groupby OrderID\n\nOther notes. SQL has more basic functions so you sometimes have to do some work arounds. For instance you can't get the entry with the largest value, instead you need to sort it and then limit the return to 1 entry.\n\nThere is one addition statement and that is the HAVING clause. This acts just like the WHERE clause but occurs AFTER the group / group by functions work... so for instance select customers and country, group by country and count the costomers then use HAVING where the count is greater than 5\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.520455683Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Characters/Aeyr":{"title":"Aeyr","content":"\nPlayer: Sydney\n\nRace: Half-Elf\n\nClass: Druid\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.522455694Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Characters/Farquad":{"title":"Farquad","content":"\nPlayer: Aerin\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.522455694Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Characters/Fiona":{"title":"Fiona","content":"\nPlayer: Dory\n\n- Imune to charm\n- half rest is the same as full rest\n- ","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.522455694Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Characters/Jedice":{"title":"Jedice","content":"\n# Meta\nRace: Human\nJob: \nBoss:\nCompanion:\nStatus: \n\n# Notes\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.522455694Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Characters/Puss":{"title":"Puss","content":"\nPlayer: Stuart\n\nRace: Cat something\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.522455694Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Characters/Tia":{"title":"Tia","content":"\n## Meta\nPlayer: Tyler\n\nRace: Half-Orc\n\nClass: Rogue\n\n## Backstory\n\nTia comes from an ancient clan of assasins from a small village in a hidden valley.

The others go through the other locked door (on the north/east end of the room) and head up the stairs opening the door.\n\n## Recap of Last Session\nAfter saving [[DnD/World/People/Ilk]] we proceed to investigate the underground cave network. We find a hidden door that looks like it may have been there before the current occupants of the cave took over for their own nefarious dealings. The key to unlocking the door seems associated with the 3 sarcophegous that we find with a flame dragon emblem on them.  \nWe also find three guards at what looks to be the normal entrance to the cave, which we decide to take out. The session ends on initiation\n\n## Log\n\n* We Enter into combat and end up taking out the guards in short order. One gets a chance to yell out but, at the end of the combat, we don't hear any other gaurds coming.\n\t* The guards are huminoid and are wearing the same type of armour as above in the bar \n\t* They both have a brand on their left chest that looks similar to the image on the sarchophageous\n* Puss and Fiona open up one of the sarcophageous. They see a human looking skeloton holding a clear orb inside. \n\t* Fiona rases the orb up with mage hand and sees 2 leters underneath it.\n\t* They get the second sarcophageous open when we start hearing some footsteps\n* We all have different plans on how to deal with the guards\n\t* 1 guard comes through, Fiona hears more gaurds coming so decides to close the door behind the 1st guard\n\t* I kill the 1st guard\n\t* Fiona scares them with some lights made to look like ghost\n\t* I go and help open the last sarcophagous\n\t\t* I see another skeleton with a clear orb\n\t\t* I would know enough to know that this is an evil god\n\t\t* Fiona rushes back towards the hidden door\n\t\t* Aery smashes 1 orb, I smash the other orb, the 3rd orb is gone\n\t\t* The guards are smashing through the door and it's starting to splinter\n\t\t* Everyone heads through the locked door that farquad unlocked. \n\t\t* I rush after Fiona is chanting the name of the god 3 times (Tiamat) when I round the corner\n\t\t\t* the hidden door turns opaque. I tell Fiona what happened in the other room. \n\t\t\t* Fiona says he wants to investigate and destroy Tiamat.\n\t\t\t* I agree and we step through the opaque door. Fiona says Tiamat 3 times and the doors turns solid again\n\t\t\t* Fiona tries to signal the others that we are ok with his dancing lights.\n\t\t* The others lock the door, head up the stairs and open the door at the top of the stairs\n\nAt the end we are split into 2 partys\n\t\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.5234557Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Sessions_Ep01/010-20220831-Hidden_Cave_Party_split":{"title":"010-20220831-Hidden_Cave_Party_split","content":"\n## Session Summary\nFiona and I enter a room with a dragon statue.

Aeyr Jams the door shut and holds them off. After investigating the sarcophegaous, Fiona figures out the name of the god after finding an orb in each of the sarcophegaous. Fiona rushes back to the secret door and Aeyr decides the orbs are dangerous and doesn't trust Fiona, so she smashes one, Tia follows her lead and smashes another.

We finally come to a large room\n\t* Upon Entry to the room\n\t\t* We see two glowing eyes about 70 m away.\n\t\t* As soon as we enter the chamber - the fog clears but the entrance is still kind of foggy\n\t\t* We see that the two eyes are two sets of eyes are attached to two heads of a very detailed statue of a five-headed dragon.\n\t\t* Fiona investigates the 1st of the four sarcophegaous. It's empty\n\t\t* We investigate the 4 statues.\n\t\t\t* A, B, C, D \n\t\t\t\t* each one has liquid in a basin that looks like the same liquid as the pool\n\t\t\t\t* the basin get progressively more full from A - D with D being full.\n\t\t\t\t\t* basin A is above the alters head\n\t\t\t\t\t* Basin D is about waste height (and is full)\n\t\t* We go investigate the alter\n\t\t\t* It's black ebony stone (can be dull and shiny at the same time)\n\t\t\t* It doesn't reflect light\n\t\t\t* We smell blood and it's stained\n\t\t\t* On top to the right is a dagger and on the left is bowl filled with the same orbs as where in the sarcophegous.\n\t\t\t\t* There are 8 orbs which are clear (whereas as the ones before were opaque)\n\t\t\t\t* The dagger is light and is made out of bone. It resembles a tooth with a handle\n\t\t\t\t* \n\t\t* The 5 heads look similar but different colors\n\t\t\t* the colors going from bowls to the Sarcophegous\n\t\t\t\t* White, black, green, blue, red\n\t\t\t* The two active heads are looking down at the alter.\n\t\t* I pick up one orb and put it in basin A.\n\t\t\t* It moves a little\n\t\t* We turn the dragon heads to look at the alter.

The other side of the pen is near the gate and the camp. about 30ft beyond the camp is more forest\n- There are 18 guards. 4 at each corner, 8 are guarding the gate. The rest are walking\n\t- We can't quite make out what the characters are on the parapet of cragmaw.\n- I look at what gundrin slipped which turns out to be some pieces of paper\n\t- 1 that is a map that looks like mine locations \n\t- 1 is a note in dwarvish\n\t- 1 is another note in dwarvish with a homemade key\n\t\t- I recognize that it is a very rare form of a skeleton key\n- They come up with a plan to hide some of us in a cart leaving the camp. this wouldn't work with for me since I'm too large\n-  \n\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.524455706Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Sessions_Ep01/029-20230705-Escape_maybe":{"title":"029-20230705-Escape_maybe","content":"\n## Session Summary\n\nWe are able to get out of the collars suppressing our magic through Fiona seducing one of the goblin guards.

Then disappears in a shower of silver. \n\n- #puss starts running towards the entrance to look for farquad\n\t- I follow and start readying some caltrops with poison\n\t- I sneak up can to see 6 guards at the entrance. They sound scared saying they aren't ready to hold of an invasion.\n\t- We are all still pretty beat up so decide we can't attack and will have to escape and find farquad later\n- We head back to the hidden exit that smells dank and super old. When we come to some stairs heading down\n- We head down the stairs, and it takes quite awhile. It looks all dwarven and all immaculate. Smells of despair, though.\n- We get to the ground floor and enter a square room with dwarven statues on the wall. There is one hallway, we walk down it. See one door on the side which we can't open. I decide not to use the skeleton key\n- At the end of the hall are two offshoots, stairs that head up and to the left and one that heads down and to the right. The moss points to the right and down\n- We continue to follow the moss. But at one point smell what smells like metal, but points away from the moss. We follow the smell and find a forge\n\t- The forge is cold, hasn't been operated for a while.\n\t- There are some ingots of silver and a metal we don't really recognize that's really lite weight.\n\t\t- We take 10 silver ingots\n\t\t- We take 6 special metal ingots\n- We head back to where the moss was pointing\n\t- come to some ornate doors that the moss is pointing to along with some small doors to the side of the ornate door that are locked.\n\t- We use the skeleton key to unlock the door. It works, but the key looks flimsier and a slightly damaged\n\t\t- it goes down some more halls. It eventually enters a throne room with a dwarven skeleton in ornate armor holding an ornate hammer, with 3 arrows sticking out of the skeleton.\n\t\t- We investigate, and it looks like the throne has similar seams. \n\t\t\t- I find two compartments on the throne that look like they might be key holes.\n\t\t\t- we decide to not use they skeleton key again unless we have to\n\t- We go back to the ornate doors. There are 3 holes and some runes. Fiona casts comprehend languages\n\t\t- The runes say  \"Thomumlir Mountainspine grants you safe journey.\"\n\t- We stick 3 hands in and find something and twist. Our hands are locked in place.

Then starts talking about some problem with the giants.\n- Felicity introduces us to the rock gnome and the goat\n- Mer is the goat and Harkess is the rock gnome\n- Fiona says the safe word and is booted out of the group\n- I talk to Felicity and convince him to help bring this safe/drugged space to others like the black spyder. He then gives us a bag and says this should give you enough for 10 trips\n\t- we open the bag, and it's filled with dead leaves from the forest\n\t- he warns to not take them out within the forest. It's not totally legit.  But it was already dead, so it's sort of ok by the tree's own rules\n- Fiona gets the feeling that we are being watched and noticed that felicity also seems to sense it\n- Aeyr says the safe word, and we are all booted. We all feel fully rested and feel so rejuvinated that get advantage on our next roll.\n- Felicity talks about some danger... but then is staring off to the left and then says something about he doesn't feel like we are alone anymore and that he has a feeling we'll be interrupted soon.\n- He warns us that there are others like him that treat people like us badly\n- we hear some noise.

There is a room and a set of stairs heading up\n\t* We pick the lock on the door and enter the room\n\t\t* the goblin in chained on a platform.

Which I pick the lock of.\n\t* In the next hallway I find a pit trap with a small ledge on one side. I scootch across past the pit trap\n\t* We pick the lock for the door after the trap\n\t* in the room are 3 sarcophagus and 2 doors. We hear some muffled conversation from 1 of the doors\n\t* I sneak to one sarcophagus. The image on top looks like flames and a drawing of a dragon\n\t* We sneak to the door with the voices and eavesdrop.\n\t\t* sounds like a couple of guards talking about how bored standing guard is... blah.. blah\n\t\t* I look under with my mirror but can't really see much\n\t* We head back to the rest of the group\n\t* Later we investigate the other door and find a stairway that leads up to another door\n* The other's stay in the room. Keeking watch and investigating\n\t* farquad investigates the walls \n\t* Aery investigates the supplies and finds general supplies like rope and rations, etc.\n\t* Faquad finds the outline of a secret door\n\t\t* Fiona determines that there is magic (from the school of abjuration) associated with the secret door. \n\t\t* Fiona investigates and pieces together words in Draconic that say **\"the Lords name 3 times\"**\n\t\t* Puss realizes that the markings seem similar to what's on the sarcophugus\n\t\t* Fiona goes to investigate the sarcophugus\n\t\t\t* They say **\"We die so that you can rise\"**\n\t\t\t* This isn't enough info to figure out yet who the masters are\n\t* We decide we need to take out the guards so we get most everyone across\n\t* We get everyone across then make some noise and draw the guards in\n\nWe Enter into combat and end up taking out the guards in short order. One gets a chance to yell out but, at the end of the combat, we don't hear any other gaurds coming.\n\t* The guards are huminoid and are wearing the same type of armour as above in the bar \n\t* They both have a brand on their left chest that looks similar to the image on the sarchophageous\n* Puss and Fiona open up one of the sarcophageous. They see a human looking skeloton holding a clear orb inside. \n\t* Fiona rases the orb up with mage hand and sees 2 leters underneath it.\n\t* They get the second sarcophageous open when we start hearing some footsteps\n* We all have different plans on how to deal with the guards\n\t* 1 guard comes through, Fiona hears more gaurds coming so decides to close the door behind the 1st guard\n\t* I kill the 1st guard\n\t* Fiona scares them with some lights made to look like ghost\n\t* I go and help open the last sarcophagous\n\t\t* I see another skeleton with a clear orb\n\t\t* I would know enough to know that this is an evil god\n\t\t* Fiona rushes back towards the hidden door\n\t\t* Aery smashes 1 orb, I smash the other orb, the 3rd orb is gone\n\t\t* The guards are smashing through the door and it's starting to splinter\n\t\t* Everyone heads through the locked door that farquad unlocked. \n\t\t* I rush after Fiona is chanting the name of the god 3 times (Tiamat) when I round the corner\n\t\t\t* the hidden door turns opaque. I tell Fiona what happened in the other room. \n\t\t\t* Fiona says he wants to investigate and destroy Tiamat.\n\t\t\t* I agree and we step through the opaque door. Fiona says Tiamat 3 times and the doors turns solid again\n\t\t\t* Fiona tries to signal the others that we are ok with his dancing lights.\n\t\t* The others lock the door, head up the stairs and open the door at the top of the stairs\n\nAt the end we are split into 2 partys\n\nFiona and I enter the coridor behind the secret door. It's darker than it should be. \n\t* It's hazy and darker than normal. almost like a mist\n\t* We proceed (investigating for traps). We finally come to a large room\n\t* Upon Entry to the room\n\t\t* We see two glowing eyes about 70 m away.\n\t\t* As soon as we enter the chamber - the fog clears but the entrance is still kind of foggy\n\t\t* We see that the two eyes are two sets of eyes are attached to two heads of a very detailed statue of a five-headed dragon.\n\t\t* Fiona investigates the 1st of the four sarcophegaous. It's empty\n\t\t* We investigate the 4 statues.\n\t\t\t* A, B, C, D \n\t\t\t\t* each one has liquid in a basin that looks like the same liquid as the pool\n\t\t\t\t* the basin get progressively more full from A - D with D being full.\n\t\t\t\t\t* basin A is above the alters head\n\t\t\t\t\t* Basin D is about waste height (and is full)\n\t\t* We go investigate the alter\n\t\t\t* It's black ebony stone (can be dull and shiny at the same time)\n\t\t\t* It doesn't reflect light\n\t\t\t* We smell blood and it's stained\n\t\t\t* On top to the right is a dagger and on the left is bowl filled with the same orbs as where in the sarcophegous.\n\t\t\t\t* There are 8 orbs which are clear (whereas as the ones before were opaque)\n\t\t\t\t* The dagger is light and is made out of bone. It resembles a tooth with a handle\n\t\t\t\t* \n\t\t* The 5 heads look similar but different colors\n\t\t\t* the colors going from bowls to the Sarcophegous\n\t\t\t\t* White, black, green, blue, red\n\t\t\t* The two active heads are looking down at the alter.\n\t\t* I pick up one orb and put it in basin A.\n\t\t\t* It moves a little\n\t\t* We turn the dragon heads to look at the alter. Their eyes glows and entrance we came in closes\n\t\t* We set the basins to mid height while the eyes are lit\n\t\t* One of the tiles behind the alter clicks. We push on it and it opens and there is a ladder heading down into thedark\n* We enter the hidden passage behind the alter\n\t* We can see a glow at the end of the tunnel\n\t* We get to the end and there is another ladder which we head up to another room\n* In the next room we see a giant flame and a door, a hook on the wall with a cloak hanging on it\n\t* nothing in the cloak. It's a full hooded cloak\n\t* Fiona puts on the cloak and it looks like he's made of shadow. \n\t* We head through the door.\n\nwe come up some stairs and come a blockage in the passage\n\t* We investigate and find a stone that looks out of place\n\t* we pull it and the wall opens\n* The others are on the other side of the wall\n\t* we enter. I jump out to scare everyone and get hit by puss\n* We are in a room at the top of a tower. Only 2 ways in/out of the room\n\t* I take a black leather book - The Devils' Circle\n\t* We loot the Desk which has\n\t\t* wax pamplet\n\t\t* brass lantern\n\t\t* a lantern painted black\n\t\t* Clear bottle - with myst in\n\t\t* Ornate golden bottle - etched with hundreds of ruins sealed with wax\n\t\t* Small frog statue made of jade\n\t\t* small poutch\n\t\t* small poutch with the smell of spices\n\t\t* silver hip flask\n\t\t* small marble statuate of a man holding a skull\n\t\t* jar filled with yellow fluid with a finger that looks like it might still twitch a bit\n\t\t* gold - 68 pieces\n\t\t* silver - 98 pieces\n\t* Puss put on a pendant and two rings\n\t\t* when he put on the pendant he couldn't speak\n\t\t* I was the only one who could take the pendant off of puss. It turns out I was the last one to talk to him before he put it on\n\t* Fiona is leading the way down the entrance the other party came through (through the mess hall). \n\t* We come back into the room with the 4 sarcophegous and there are bodies everywhere\n\t\t* we see a blood trail that looks like someone (skeletal footprints) walked through the carnage, and they go through the door the guards originaly came through.\n\t\t* We surmise that the 2 orbs we broke re-animated 2 skeletons, which went rampant and killed all of the guards.\n\t\t* There is 1 skeleton that was destroyed and 1 remaining somewhere in the cave\n\t* We head out the door the guards came through\n\t\t* We head up find a door. Burst through it.\n\t\t* We are in a room with stained-glass windows, a plain altar, and some bunk beds.\n\t\t* We see pools of blood and drag marks out the other door.\n# Leaving the Hidden Cave\n\nWe re-barricade the door entering the \"church\"\n* Looking around we see a blood trail leading through the door going outside\n\t* Fiona opens the door to check outside, and a crossbow bolt almost hit him.\n\t* He hides behind a pew, then opens the door with mage-hand. We still can't see anything so he casts dancing lights in humenoid form and sends it out. Dancing lights are casts in return and surround his light\n\t* I look around the door with my mirror\n\t\t* I don't see any movement\n\t\t* I see just dense bush\n\t* The bartender comes in with a bunch of her goons\n\t\t* We fight.

It's dangerous work and doesn't pay well. I notice the owner's are charging 3 copper for dinner but, they only charge the miners 1/2 a copper. I take this to mean that the miner's don't get very much pay and they are helping them.\n\t\t\t\t* Everyone has been layed off due to the goblin problem. It seems like the town council has promised that it will be taken care of soon.\n\t\t\t* Puss talkes to Orin and Inspera about Merys\n\t\t\t\t* Orin suggests 2 paths\n\t\t\t\t\t* negotiate with her and release her OR\n\t\t\t\t\t* kill her and dispose of the body\n\t\t\t\t* Orin things that Merys might be an employee of someone else which could be good or bad\n\t\t\t\t\t* If we kill Mery's, it might be just a blip on Mery's employers radar or it might bring us to their attention which would be dangerous\n\t\t\t\t\t* If we negotiate with Mery's we could also come to Mery's employers radar as well.\n\t\t\t\t* They knew that something like the dragon tunnel's exhisted but they didn't think they were powerful enough to go down there.\n\t\t\t\t\t* Puss uses minor illusion to share with them we saw in the tunnels\n\t\t\t\t\t* Puss ask's about who Mery's is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t* Mery's doesn't value anyone who works for her or their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t* She's powerful and not to be trifuled with.\n\t\t\t* Puss goes in search of a swashbuckler's hat and some general exploring the town.\n\t\t\t\t* We start getting winter coats\n\t\t\t\t* Fiona ask's about maybe lining his shadow coat.\n\t\t\t\t\t* and learns that it's glamer weave.\n\t\t\t\t* I get two clothing sets one dark and one light. both quiet clothing\n\t\t\t\t* I also get an outer winter coat that's dark on the outside and motled multicolored on the inside\nI pick up some honey and put it in my poison flask.\nWe sneak Marys back out of the city and find a clearing in the woods to talk to her.

She assumes they are using cragma keep as their hideout\n\t\t* She doesn't seem thrilled about the miners federation\n* We agree to work for her to deal with the black spider\n* She stepped back 10 feet, yelled something in a loud voice. We felt a large force and she disapeared. We then hear a voice in our head saying \"I will be in touch\"\n\nAfter dealing with Marys and letting her go. We head back to town\n\nWhen we enter the tavern, there is a male halfing that calls us over and says he is happy to be our new aquaintance\n* We join the halfling\n\t* He introduces himself as Cyrus (Mistress Mary's Aid)\n\t* He pulls out 5 parchments and hands each of us one and explains that this is our employee contract with Marys\n\t* The contract states\n\t\t* We are the employed by Marys\n\t\t* our payment agreement (release of Ilk and keeping of the treasures we aquired from Mary's hidden cave)\n\t* He also hands us badges that we can use to show that we are employed by Marys if there are any issues\n\t* He slips us a document stating that our mining fee has been fulfilled, and we can now enter any mine in our search for the goblins\n\t\t* Each miner that enters a mine has to pay a fee to mine, and then get paid for anything they find\n\t* He also hands us a map of the surounding countryside including\n\t\t* mine locations\n\t\t* suspected locations of the goblin strongholds\n* We go to sleap\n* We are worried since marys and Cyrus maybe have access to some mind reading of us. So we head to splelunking to see if they have anything that can help us\n\t* She has one ring of mind shielding\n\t* She could make more but the supplies needed would take a while about a month\n\t* She wonders if there is something we have that is causing the dreams\n\t* I cast identify on the marble statue with the man holding a skull\n\t\t* It's enchanted - and it's the cause of the nightmares\n\t\t* As I try to pull it out of my satchel - something happens and I can't bring myself to expose it. Instead I am forced to cast Minor Illusion to show it to the others\n\t\t* It appears to be otherworldly\n\t\t* I ask them to look into some sort of material or contain that I could use to contain the statue in so that it doesn't affect others\n* We go to the mining tavern and ask for some information\n\t* The goblin attacks seem sort of random\n\t* They always come from the surface and almost appears as if they are searching for something\n\t* The attacks on the miners appears more to be calatoral damage\n* We head to the latest mine that was attacked by goblins #lyzas_tears\n\t* We notice that the goblin tracks come straight from the forested area and head straight to the mine entrance\n\t* We head into the mine - It's unnaturally quiet\n# Mine of Lyzas Tears\n\nWe had into the mine #lyzas_tears . We see some tracks, some abandoned equipment and some bodies\n* the bodies are about 2 days old, which is about when the attack was supposed to have happened.\n* We head into the mine. Sse a few more bodies\n* We come to a larger open area\n\t* Looks like this was where the miners took a stand with stacked up carts, etc.\n\t* We see 6 dead goblins, 15 dead miners\n\t* All of the goblins have the same emblen we saw before of the black spyder\n\t\t* Ilk recognizes the emblem from before he was taken a slave \n\t* There are 6 entrances into this cavern. 1 Large passage and the others are smaller passages\n\t* We head down the largest passageway\n\t* We come to the end of the main branch and find 3 smaller branch offs\n\t\t* The center ends quickly\n\t\t* left goes down\n\t\t* right goes up\n\t* We head down the left branch deaper. \n\t* We come to a giant opening and find an underground lake\n\t* We had back then go down the right passage\n\t\t* We trip a tripwire. Hear some rumbling that sounds surprisingly lound. It lasts a while and sounds like the tripwire set off a cave in near the entrance\n\t\t* We hear some shuffling sounds, more like something is being dragged\n\t\t* Aeyr sneaks ahead to see what she can see. Looks like the ground is moving.\n\t\t\t* There are about 20 of them, grub looking creatures\n\t\t\t* They are moving and pulling a large group of miner bodies\n\t\t* The grubs hear fiona and Farquad coming up. We now see there are 30 of them\n\t\t* Fiona shoots 3 with magic missile \n\t\t* The Grubs start running towards us\n\t\t\t* We start attacking\n\t\t\t* We hear something really loud coming, we can't tell from where it's coming\n\t\t* We killed 3\n\t\t\t* I damaged another for 8 damage\n\t\t\t* Puss damaged one for 8 damage\n\t\t\t* 2 are asleep\n\t\t30 Total - 3 dead\n\t\t* Puss Kills a 4th\n\t\t* Fiona kills a 5th\n\t\t* We hear another bellow that sounds closer. We are starting to figure out that the grubs mother is coming. Puss decides to start the tactical retreat back towards farquad's turret\n\t\t* We get back to farquad.

Even when I go to put back in the bag I can't let go.\n\t* I put myself to sleep\n\t\t* Fiona shot the statue a couple of times with firebolt and it was cracked\n\t\t* when I woke up, I stabbed the stature with my dagger. Each time it hurt me just as much as it hurt the stature. eventually the damage broke however.\n\t* After the statue breaks we are temporaily blinded by a bright flash and then we roll intitiative\n\t\t* Right next to me is a woman on the ground who appears unconcous and dressed in fine clothes\n\t* Fiona yells out Hag!! and shoots magic missile\n\t* I stab her a little to see if hurting her still hurts me\n\t* when I try to get up she grabs my hand and says help me\n\t\t* I believe her\n\t* Fiona keeps shooting her with magic missile\n\t* she finally looks at all of us and says \"I only require my property, (pointing to me) and then I'll let the rest of you live\" then shoots fiona and knocks him out with a second magic missile \n\nI stabalize Fiona, The hag puts me to sleep\n- As people are hitting her, normal attacks don't seemt to affect her much\n- Aeyr hits her with moon beam (radiant) damage and she screams in extreme pain\n- farquad activates his turret and hits the hag with lightning damage\n\t- it hurts her\n- We kill the hag there is left a\n\t- heart stone\n\t- a leather bag\n- I cast identify on the leather bag\n\t- It's called a soul bag, it is made of human flesh, it does not currently have a soul in it.\n- Farquad tries to explode the turret near the rockwall. it makes a divet but doesn't open it up\n- We take a long rest\n\t- For the first time in a while we don't have nightmares\n- the water has come down some\n- Fiona throws a rock and we can all now hear it when it hits the water\n- The water is starting to recede\n- We start swimming and find a cave with just a little bit of airspace in. \n\nWe are working our way through the water passage in the cave\n* We swim for a full day\n* Fionea, puss, tia, don't hear anything but Aeyr, Farquad hear screaming\n\t* We surmize that they are hallucinating\n* We take a third point of exhaustion\n# Leaving the Mines and back to Phandalin\n* We finally come out of the water passage and are at a small lake. We make it to the shore\n* We start hearing slow clapping and we see Marys standing near us. She starts a fire 15 feet away from us\n* There is a pot of stew on the fire that she offers to us\n* She informs us that there have been 2 other attacks. She's going to take the left over people she has to go investigate one of the attack locations, and she says we should go investigate the other.\n* We take a long rest. In the morning we see we are in a valley. The cave was east of the town. We don't really know where we are at. We start hiking up to some high ground and see some chimney smoke that looks like it's probably Phandalin\n* We hike aways, go to stop, there isn't really a spot to stop, and then hike into the woods a little then take another long rest.\n\t* Farquad sets an alarm spell\n* We make it back to Phandalin\n* We notice the miners eatery the #yawning_pot is pretty active\n\t* Puss and I decide to stop off and get some food there\n\t\t* We get info on where gavin's sister lives, so we can return the ring to her.\n\t\t* We hear about 2 attacks at the following mines\n\t\t\t* #ebon \n\t\t\t\t* 2 days ago\n\t\t\t* #grand_venture \n\t\t\t\t* 4 days ago\n\t\t* We hear about Marys and knights of the void, and they are perceived pretty well\n\t\t* There is some anger that starting to appear towards the miner's guild because they are pushing for more mining and are thinking of sending work parties back to #lyzas_tears \n* Fiona, Farquad, Aeyr, head to the Inn\n* Long Rest\n* We chat with the inn keaper\n\t* there is talk about the goblins being holed up in some long lost dwarven place called #cragma \n* We go around and pick up our orders from the seamstress and the magic shop\n\nIdentified Loot\n\t* Circulet if vines\n\t\t* turn into a tree for 10 hr. you can communicate with the other trees.

They slip me 2 gold coins for our troubles.\n* Picked up 6 throwing-stars from the blacksmith\n* We head to the most recent goblin attack\n# Back tot he Mines in search of the Goblins\n* As we are coming up to the mine I start hearing voices arguing/yelling\n\t* Looks like a group of miners arguing with another group that's all one in one uniform that looks like the miner's guild\n\t* We decide to approach the two groups and ask what's going on.\n\t* The miner's deep in the mine were attacked by goblins and the guild is wanting to blow the entrance and seal in the goblins. The Miner's are arguing, the guild doesn't want to wait.\n* We walk up and ask what's going on. The guild rep makes a snyde remark about us being mary's slave and say's he'll blow the entrance with us in it\n\t* I pick up the bureaucrats and intimidate by picking him up by the shirt collar and ask who's calling us slave\n\t* He say's \"unhand\" me you half-breed\n\t* There's some back and forth. Doesn't look like the guild is backing down.\n* The guild start trying to blow the entrance so we attack\n\t* We killed 2 spell casters.

It states that if it's possible (as long as it's not too difficult) they should try to rescue the miners. However, the insurance they have on the miner's means they would come out with profits either way.\n\t\t* I chat with farquad about converting one of the longbows into a shortbow\nThe warriors are wearing a flaked male chess piece\nAery and I notice that Ilk take one of the dagger's from the bodies and hides it on his person\n\nWe decide to head into the cave and rest just inside the cave\n# Captured by the goblins and taken to Cragma\n* Fiona hears someone shuffling and sees a miner with goblin arrows in him.

Based on the sound and smell, it doesn't seem like we are with the main group of goblins. \n\t* We can still hear the one hobglobin.\n\t* After about an hour we are hoisted up into what seems like a wagon. We can smell horses.\n\t* We aren't alone in the wagon.\n* I remove my hood.\n\t* We are in an iron cage on top of a wagon along with 15 other miners. I hear some shouts and the wagon starts moving. \n\t* There are 6 wagons with 1 driver and 1 guard, and hobglobin on a horse.\n\t* The miners don't have any handcuffs on. Their hands are free.\n* We travel for a couple of hours\n\t* Meanwhile I try to get info from the miners what happened\n\t\t* They were all recently captured just hours before we showed up.\n\t\t* They were captured from Grand Venture mine (we were at the Eden Mine).\n\t\t* The grand venture mine is where Marys went to\n\t\t* I try to give the miners some hope and comfort. They start feeling better\n\t* We come up to a smoother more ancient seeming road.\n* We come up to some structures\n\t* There are multiple fires with hundreds of goblins around them\n\t* There are a few towers but they are weathered and somewhat crumpled\n\t* There is a drawbridge but the moat is dry\n\t* After we enter the entrance is shut with an iron gate\n\t* We can also see some shadows up on the ramparts\n* The wagon stops and they unload us\n\t* The miners are taken through one path of the fortress\n\t* The hob globin decides that he will escort us as a special prize for the boss\n\t\t* The goblins call hime #Argov\n\t* He leads us into the fortress and into a grand chamber\n\t\t* It's a square room by about 100 ft by 300 wide\n\t\t* There are stone statues (some of them have smashed) and they look dwarven made\n\t\t* At the far end is a thick ornate table with some weird magical lamps that are glowing\n\t\t* There are 4 different entrances, 2 off of each side.\n\t\t* Standing in front of the table is a person that is the spitting image of #Marys, and she is talking to a halfling.\n\t\t\t* The halfling walks away through one of the side doors\n\t\t* When the person turns we see that one side of the face is the spitting image of #Marys but the other half of the face is burned horribly\n\t\t* She gets mad that Ilk is with us saying \"why is their kind here\" and gets some guards to come and drag him away.\n\t\t\t* Aeyr trys to grab Ilk but she gets back handed\n\t\t* She says #mavehous fix this.\n\t\t\t* A tiefling seems to appear out of nowhere and magically stablizes Aery and then poors a healing potion down their throat\n\t\t* She Tells Argov. \"No times for games. As long as her pieces off of the board. We only need 1 more gem, Either put them into the games or make them diggers it doesn't matter. We have 5 days before we hit the last site. It doesn't matter.\"\n\t* Argov leads us away. We eventually down some stairs into a dark, wet area. Argov is grumbling to himself and he sounds unsure of himself.\n\t\t- We eventually come to a room with rows and rows and rows of cells. All of them are empty except for one that has a lump in a corner we can't really see.\n\t\t- He puts us in the cell next to the one occupied and lines us up\n\t\t\t- The tiefling appears and puts a collar around our neck. After the collar is around our neck he removes the shackles\n\t\t\t- We still don't have access to magic\n\t\t\t- Across from us and down the room is a table with 3 other hobglobins\n\t\t\t- The Teifling smiles at us then dissapears \n\t\t- It turns out the person in the cell next to us #Gundrin \n\t\t- Farquad asks if he found the #forge_of_spells \n\t\t\t- He gets too emotional and says that if it wasn't for his quest then #Zaron the drow witch, wouldn't have used his map to get so much power.\n\t\t- I ask gundrin about the collars around our neck. He says he doesn't know much about them but says they aren't dwarven but are ancient. \n\t\t- I ask Gundrin about the teifline\n\t\t\t- He looks ashamed and  says he was approached by her in neverwinter and he let spill about his mission about the #forge_of_spells . \n\t\t- Puss asks if he knows what's the pieces are that #Zaron is looking for\n\t\t\t- He doesn't think #forge_of_spells exhists. She's after something more sinister. She needs 5 gems to get it. Each gem is a dwarven key to a storage/treasure. \n\t\t- Gundrin says if we could escape he could get to the gem first. But he doesn't think he can escape\n\t\t- I try to pick the lock but am unsuccesful \n\t- Argov shows up in the morning. Says it's time for some fun. Puts shackles on #Gundrin and opens our cell, then leads us out. We can start hearing a lot of commotion. We are lead out into a courtyard with a 20 ft pit with crude stands set up around it.\n\t- Gundrin lowers himself down into the pit.\n\t- Argov selects me and pushes me into the pit.\nI spend a while trying to taunt and convince the goblins that this is a week fight. Gundrin finally convinces me that he wants me to kill him so I eventually attack.\n- While fighting #Gundrin he slips something under my armour\n- I end up killing #Gundrin \n- Shakles are put on me as I come out the pit\n- We are taken off to a pen in a camp. The pen is filled with some goblins.\n- Ilk is in the pen\n\t- Fiona askes him if anyone in the group can help us get the shakles and collars off\n\t- Ilk runs to some goblins that look like they are elders chats with them and brings us a lock pick\n\t- We pick our locks\n- Fiona talks with the chiefs and asks if there is any way they could help us escape and that we would help set them free if we can if we can escape\n- One side of the pen is near an open forest. The other side of the pen is near the gate and the camp. about 30ft beyond the camp is more forest\n- There are 18 guards. 4 at each corner, 8 are guarding the gate. The rest are walking\n\t- We can't quite make out what the characters are on the parapet of cragmaw.\n- I look at what gundrin slipped which turns out to be some pieces of paper\n\t- 1 that is a map that looks like mine locations \n\t- 1 is a note in dwarvish\n\t- 1 is another note in dwarvish with a homemade key\n\t\t- I recognize that it is a very rare form of a skeleton key\n- They come up with a plan to hide some of us in a cart leaving the camp. this wouldn't work with for me since I'm too large\n# Escape from the Goblins\n\nFiona seduces one of the guards\n\t- leads them away from the main gate\n\t- He convinces the guard to help him remove his collar\n- I pick the lock \n- The guard then comes back with a rod with runes and says this will remove the collar but he doesn't know how to use it.\n\t- he asks for a reward first\n\t- Fiona kisses the guard\n\t- the guard gives him the rod\n- Fiona is able to remove his collar\n\t- Fiona convinces the guard to give him the key\n\t- he gives the guard the hag finger\n\t- and convinces the guard to go to his tent\n- Fiona hands the rod around to unlock our collars\n- There's about 60+ other goblins locked up in the pen with us\n- We go to release the collars of the elders and they stop us\n\t- They say they picked their fate, and releasing them would mean the blood of their loved ones\n- We enter the keep to search for our gear taken from us\n- We come into the main rrom and see the desk the black spider was behind\n\t- there are protective wards over the documents\n\t- we can see a map that is similar to gundrins but a little more detailed terrain wise while gundrins has a little more details of important features\n\t- There are 3 doors that are trapped\n\t\t- middle is a rune *unsure the spell*\n\t\t- the other two are physical traps\n\t\t\t- left and right a bolt will spring through the key hole to strike the person\n\t\t\t- we cast mage hand and remove the bolts \n\t\t\t- Left door opens to a series of rooms that look like storage rooms\n\t\t\t\t- one of the rooms has pseudo hidden exit. It is more of a trick of the wall blending in, but you can't see the exit until you are right up against it.\n\t\t\t- We go into the right door, it's an armoury and we find our shit\nWe head back to the illusion/hidden passage and decide to check it out\n\t- it's dark and we can't see very far\n\t- drops off pretty quickly\n\t- smells like earth and water?\n- We go back to the door with a spell on it.\n\t- It's locked, I'm able to unlock it with magehand.\n\t- We push open the door with magehand and see a long hallway with a door at the other end.\n\t- Puss throws a breastplate through the door\n\t- A fireball spell is released by the trap hitting Puss and Fiona. This trips the trap so no spell is in the doorway anymore\n\t- We go through into the room at the end of the hall way and find a desk, some journals written in a coded language, a couple armoires, and a bed\n\t\t- there are some drawings in the journals that we can see #black_spyder_journal.\n\t\t\t- Detailed sketches of some caverns\n\t\t\t- A detailed sketch of some statues in the town square of #Phandalin \n\t\t- Things we find\n\t\t\t- blask_spyder_journal\n\t\t\t- 122 copper\n\t\t\t- 68 silver\n\t\t\t- 229 Gold\n\t\t\t- 4 potions of healing\n\t\t\t- bronze sconce set with 12 diamonds\n\t\t\t- set of ruby earrings on gold hooks\n\t\t\t- set of earrings with tiny dragon scales on silver hooks\n\t\t\t- short sword with a silver looking blade that glimmers like moonlight and is cold to touch\n\t\t\t- wood sword that is like sapling\n\t\t\t- light green cloak\n\t\t\t- small rusty knife with hammet etched on the blade\n\t\t\t- small crystal pyramid. It starts to glow with rainbow colors as soon as someone picks it up.\n\t\t\t- Small vial with an ornate silver latch filled with blue stones\n\t\t\t- Set of pan pipes help together cord\n\t\t- Puss finds\n\t\t\t- a small bracelet where the wearer always wins at a game of rock paper scissors no matter what.\n\t\t- Fiona finds\n\t\t\t- heavy boots studded with iron plates. When a command is spoken, the boots all of a sudden weigh 500 lbs.\n\t\t- Aeyr Finds\n\t\t\t- rough leather armor covered in sigils, looks well-worn. All elemental spells cast by wearer are given an additional 1d8\n\t\t- Tia finds\n\t\t\t- I find a sigil which 3 times a day I can raise the sigil and cast a bright light causing 3d10 damage to all within 30 feet of me. All plants within range grow faster\n\t\t- Farquad finds\n\t\t\t- a book that you can enter another dimension with a flower garden?\n\t\t- Ilk Finds\n\t\t\t- A blanket of warmth. Keeps user warm no matter the weather\n\t- We see out of the corner of our eyes in the hallway, the teifling #mavehous that was talking to the black spyder. She's blended into the shadows and we more see the glimmer of the shadows surrounding her. She winks at us and turns and run.\n\t- #mavehous stabs a sigil in the desk sounding off an alarm and causing the doors on the side of the room to slam shut\n\t\t- we chase after her.\n\t\t- she is heading out the main entrance towards the camp. we are fighting as she runs\n\t\t- she is just at the exit hallway and is looking pretty haggard.\n\t\t\t- puss and I are in striking distance of her.\n\n#mavehous turns to me and say that \"clan\" recognizes \"clan\" and that she recognizes my fighting style and that she can smell balders gate on puss' fur. She says dying wouldn't be a service to her mistress and says something about running. Then disappears in a shower of silver. \n\n- #puss starts running towards the entrance to look for farquad\n\t- I follow and start readying some caltrops with poison\n\t- I sneak up can to see 6 guards at the entrance. They sound scared saying they aren't ready to hold of an invasion.\n\t- We are all still pretty beat up so decide we can't attack and will have to escape and find farquad later\n# Escape into the Dwarven Caves\n- We head back to the hidden exit that smells dank and super old. When we come to some stairs heading down\n- We head down the stairs, and it takes quite awhile. It looks all dwarven and all immaculate. Smells of despair, though.\n- We get to the ground floor and enter a square room with dwarven statues on the wall. There is one hallway, we walk down it. See one door on the side which we can't open. I decide not to use the skeleton key\n- At the end of the hall are two offshoots, stairs that head up and to the left and one that heads down and to the right. The moss points to the right and down\n- We continue to follow the moss. But at one point smell what smells like metal, but points away from the moss. We follow the smell and find a forge\n\t- The forge is cold, hasn't been operated for a while.\n\t- There are some ingots of silver and a metal we don't really recognize that's really lite weight.\n\t\t- We take 10 silver ingots\n\t\t- We take 6 special metal ingots\n- We head back to where the moss was pointing\n\t- come to some ornate doors that the moss is pointing to along with some small doors to the side of the ornate door that are locked.\n\t- We use the skeleton key to unlock the door. It works, but the key looks flimsier and a slightly damaged\n\t\t- it goes down some more halls. It eventually enters a throne room with a dwarven skeleton in ornate armor holding an ornate hammer, with 3 arrows sticking out of the skeleton.\n\t\t- We investigate, and it looks like the throne has similar seams. \n\t\t\t- I find two compartments on the throne that look like they might be key holes.\n\t\t\t- we decide to not use they skeleton key again unless we have to\n\t- We go back to the ornate doors. There are 3 holes and some runes. Fiona casts comprehend languages\n\t\t- The runes say  \"Thomumlir Mountainspine grants you safe journey.\"\n\t- We stick 3 hands in and find something and twist. Our hands are locked in place. The outline of the king and his hammer is eliminated his name flashes 3 times.\nAeyr tries to pick up the hammer at the foot of the dwarven king skeleton. It blasts her back then the skeleton stands up\n\t- The king speaks out \"unwelcome visitors why do you disturb our slumber\"\n- Aeyr explains what we are trying to escape from and that her companions are stuck in the door. \n- The king asks her to take him to us\n- the king laughs at us and says something about \"oh more non dwarvish kind trying to enter my kingdom un invited\"\n- we ask for safe passage he agrees if we give him a personal item each.\n\t- I give him the whiskey for thorin. He takes a sip, says it's been forever since he's had true dwarven whiskey.. \n\t\t- He releases us\n\t\t- then says - the whiskey is for the living not the dead and hands it back to me\n\t- I ask him if he'll translate the Gundrin's note\n\t\t- he is hesitant. and I explain about gundrin died giving it to us\n\t\t- the note is how to open the ancient.\n\t\t\t- Needs 5 specific orbs placed in certain spots around the ancient forge\n\t\t- He asks that we not meddle in ancient dwarven magic\n\t\t- I explain that the black spyder has 3 of the orbs already. \n\t\t\t- He looks pretty shook, then hands me his hammer and says this is the closest he can do to help us.\n\t\t- As the king walks away, he slips a knife from his belt to Ilk.\n\t\t- The hammer is heavy\n- We go through the door, and it closes behind us.\n- We take a long rest\n- We head down the tunnel. It's heading downward slightly. We start to hear rushing water\n- At the end of the path. There is a rail track with some upturned mining carts and a raging river\n- We turn over some of the carts. and decide to jump in and ride the cart\n- We get going pretty fast\n- Fiona and I start using mage hand to try to slow us down slightly\n- We leave the tunnel and see the rail go up in the air... and the track is damage. \n\t- We start to jump. Aeyr get's stuck and Puss, Ilk, and I try to help. \n\t- Fiona jumps clear\n\t- The rest of us go over with the cart\n\t- We land in a lake and get hurt\n\t- Ilk is knocked unconscious\n\t- We make our way to the shore \n# Leaving the Caves and entering the Forest\n\nFiona makes his way down to us. Only half of our rations survive\n- We take a long rest\n- we start foraging as we are trying to find our way out of the forest\n- We continue in the direction where the rail tracks was following around the mountain\n- we don't really feel like we are finding our way out\n- Aery turns into a tree, then chats with the trees around us. \n\t- They mention another 3 groups that have intruded on the trees. One of the groups they seem apprehensive about. the other 2 are younger and they are unsure about them.\n\t- The other groups are about 2 days away. \n- We decide to go and try to find the other group\n- We start hearing some noise that sounds like a lite tune. we are able to follow it and head towards it.\n- Puss and I sneak up. As we get close we see a rectangular clearing. At the far side we see 3 creatures \n\t- rock gnome\n\t- goat\n\t- something between halfling and half elf. really fair skin almost goldish or even almost metallic sheen\n- the torches are floating and the harp is playing itself\n- Only the not halfling not half elf is doing the talking and it's laughing at it's own jokes\n- We enter and announce ourselves. the not elf person looks friends and happily beckons us forward offering us food and drink\n- Aeyr does an arcana check is all over the map. there's lots of magic going on.\n- He points to the goat and introduces him as Mertc\n- We introduce ourself\n- He introduces himself as Fel-elicity. He seems to be moving with a limp\n\t- Puss asks him about the limp. he passes it off as some other group not friendly\n\t- he tries to pour us wine but he seems to have a hard time pouring and spills it\n- He seems suspicious but we aren't really sure what's going on\n- I decide to go ahead and eat some of the food.. then my eyes glaze over and I have a slunk look like the rock gnome and the goat\nEvery one else ends up taking the food, and we are all drugged.\nNothing is wrong, but everything around us is vibrant. The quiet forest has come to life. The goat and gnome are awake, and you are able to talk to them. Anyone that didn't eat seems blurry\n- Felicity is happy and says \"see this is a safe space, eat and be happy\".\n- Fiona asks Felicity has heard about the blackspyder\n\t- He says he's heard the name but can't remember anything else. Then starts talking about some problem with the giants.\n- Felicity introduces us to the rock gnome and the goat\n- Mer is the goat and Harkess is the rock gnome\n- Fiona says the safe word and is booted out of the group\n- I talk to Felicity and convince him to help bring this safe/drugged space to others like the black spyder. He then gives us a bag and says this should give you enough for 10 trips\n\t- we open the bag, and it's filled with dead leaves from the forest\n\t- he warns to not take them out within the forest. It's not totally legit.  But it was already dead, so it's sort of ok by the tree's own rules\n- Fiona gets the feeling that we are being watched and noticed that felicity also seems to sense it\n- Aeyr says the safe word, and we are all booted. We all feel fully rested and feel so rejuvinated that get advantage on our next roll.\n- Felicity talks about some danger... but then is staring off to the left and then says something about he doesn't feel like we are alone anymore and that he has a feeling we'll be interrupted soon.\n- He warns us that there are others like him that treat people like us badly\n- we hear some noise. We get ready\n- I hide near the side of the woods where the noise is coming from and I am super well hidden\n- 4 shapes step out\n\t- 1 Drows\n\t- 2 kobolds (1 red, 1 blue)\n\t- 1 Tiefling\n- They in a blue and black color scheme that is coordinated, and it seems familiar\n- The drow says \"I told you we would find it.. Stop damaging the trees! And stares at the Tiefling\"\n- Harkness address the group... their eventual response is \"if you know what's good for you, you'll get away from that worm (Felicity).\n- The drow whistles.. And from the opposite side of the clearing 6 more figures come out\n\t- 2 goblins\n\t- 1 orc\n\t- 3 drow\n- The Main drow says enough talk and draws her bow. Her arrows don't look like standard arrows\n\t- they are long, black, and have corkscrew tipped arrows dripping\n- I coat my dagger and shortsword with poison\n- Fiona holds his action ready to toss firebolt if attacks happen\nThe group that steps out and we are confronting are:\n- 4 drow\n- 2 orc\n- 2 kobolds\n- 1 tiefling\n\nInitiative order\n- puss 20\n- tia 17\n- felicity 16\n- fiona 11\n- Harkness and Mer 7\n- Aery and Ilk - 3\n\nThe Drow says enough and starts pulling back her bow shoots at Felicity, misses and almost hits Ilk.\nWe start fighting.\n- I sneak up behind the drow\n- one of the drow misses their shot and hits a tree...\n\t- aery gets the immediate feeling that the forest is pissed\n- I attack from hiding getting a #surprise_attack and kill a drow\n- Puss takes out 1 creature\n- I get a dreadfull feeling from the trees around me.\n\t- I try to communicate to the trees that I'll help them take care of the people hurting them\n- I kill another drow\n\t- afterwards vines come out of the ground and drag the drow's body into the forest\n- Aery Roasts 2 goblins with moonbeam\nThe group that steps out and we are confronting are:\n- 4 drow\n- 2 orc\n- 2 kobolds\n- 1 tiefling\n\nInitiative order\n- puss 20\n- tia 17\n- felicity 16\n- fiona 11\n- Harkness and Mer 7\n- Aery and Ilk - 3\n\nFight continues:\n- Drow 1 yells \"Enough of this\" and reaches into her cloak to draw out an orb.\n\t- we recognize the orb as the same type as what he found in the basement but instead of white it's filled with a blue smoke, which she smashes and inhales the smoke\n\t- We have to do a constitution save throw\n\t\t- We see a flash of a shape that looks like a dragon and are we are now scared, so all our rolls are at disadvantage and can't move towards her\n- The drow blows up shouting out a lightning attack that sets the forest on fire and knocks out #Felicity. Felicity tosses ilk into a rope trick portal before getting knocked out\n- We get Ilk back and load up Felicity on Mer\n- We head away from the fire and head down the path the drow group came from\n- The forest is more quiet than normal and we get a weird feeling\n- I study the poisoned arrow some but can't figure it out\n- I give Felicity some of the tree leaves. This snaps him awake.\n- It's starting to snow which Felicity noticies and says is bad. Really bad.\n\t- The forest is somewhat sentient but it's dying now and we are in the middle of it.\n- Felicity says he can probably get us out of there but we have to close our eyes and not open them it might not work\n\t- It works..Seems like we are flying. Then he realizes he doesn't really know where to take us.\n\t- He eventually says he sees a settlement so takes us down.\n\t- It turns out it's the goblin settlement, but it's been destroyed including the goblins and the councel of old goblins. Bodies everywhere.\n\t- We don't see the body of Farquad.\n- The burning looks similar to what happened to the forrest\n- I asked about the group... but Felicity says he's not sure if he can tell us.\n- We look around and enter the Fortress to see what we can find\n\t- When we enter the chamber we see the bodies of the bugbear that made us fight, the half drow that we ran into on our escape and on dais we see the body of the black spyder (Merys look alike)\nAfter the previous fight, we level up.\n# Back to Cragma\nFelicity brings us to cragma and we find now that everyone is killed included the #black_spyder, her minions, and the goblins enslaved by their own kind.\n- We investigate the bodies and find\n- On Bugbear\n\t- stab wounds and caved in skull\n\t- 6 gold\n\t- great axe\n- Half Drow\n\t- multiple stab wounds\n\t- 35 gold\n\t- a plethora of daggers\n- #black_spyder \n\t- She is burned but still alive just unconscious\n\t- 3 soul orbs they are white and empty\n\t- In her hand we find a dwarvish orb\n\t\t- This is the type of orb that the #black_spyder was saying that they found 4 of the five.\n\t- We tie up the #black_spyder \n- Fiona examines the special orb and it's warm\n- I hold the dwarvish orb and cast identify\n- During long rest I hear some claining sound\n\t- It sounds like it's coming towards us and it sounds like some thing is striking the wall.\n\t- There is a very strong rank order coming down the passageway\n- Out comes an ogre and a goblin which say \"oh she said there would be leftovers!\"\n- A battle commences\n\t- we kill both the ogre and the goblin\nAfter killing the ogre and goblin, we check out the bodies. We don't find anything.\nI search around and find a crossbow painted blue\nWe take a long rest\n- I take the potion of mind reading\n\t- We get flashes of a war machine\n\t- We see her being commanded by a fiery voice to find the #vonindod\n\t- we can't tell who is commanding her\n\t- I also see flashes of giants and dragons\n\t- Also get flashes of the dwarvish orbs and there is sense of triumph especially the last one which we found on her. \n\t- There is an ancient way against giants and dragons\n\t\t- dragons have historically been the top of the food chain\n\t\t- giants wanted that\n\t- There was an epic war between them\n\t- The giants created the #vonindod to ravage the land. It got destroyed, but part of it was buried below the town of #Phandalin .\n\t- She was sent by someone to find the #vonindod\n\t- She is on the side of giants\n\t- the orbs open the chamber where the dwarfs kept the portion of the #vonindod that they had. And the last orb, which is the one we found, powers the portion of the #vonindod\n\t- I ask what happened to the other orbs\n\t\t- Our employer has the other 5\n\t- I ask if they are sisters\n\t\t- She says the drow families are complicated\n\t- Aery heals her some when she starts coughing up blood\n\t\t- she seems shocked and unsure\n\t- we get images of mary's group being the group that attacked her and stole the orbs\n\t- I ask if she wants revenge\n\t\t- there is fear but the fear is more that she's afraid of when her masters' find out that they failed.\n\t- #Marys is on the side of the dragons\n\t- I don't get any sense of deception from her\n- I take Ilk and leave the room and #Aery follows me\n- Fiona then kills #black_spyder after we leave the room\n- We go look for some sign of #farquad all that we find is his bottle that held his hand sanitizer.\n\t- #Aery realizes that #farquad would still be alive based on what she knows about the spell they used for the sanitizer \n- We leave cragma and eventually find our way to the cave where we were captured\n# Back to Phandalin\n- As we approach #Phandalin we see black smoke on the horizon\n\t- We find bodies of miners that look pretty brutalized\n\t- we find some bodies of goblins, ogres, and bugbears mixed in\n\t- As well as some bodies from the #lords_alliance group\n- The slums are burned down\n- There's some damage to the miners guild building but it looks mainly untouched.\n- We walk through town to #spelunkin \n\t- It looks relatively untouched but we can tell some spells have happened around there\n\t- Doors is locked but no one answers\n\t- we try picking the lock and trip a trap knocking us off the porch \n\nI head over to the Lord's Alliance. It looks hastily abandoned but there's a note \n\t- the Note says if there are any survivors to head to the safe location in the woods. \n- I head to the Inn. As I enter, I hear some slight rustling from upstairs.\n- I sneak upstairs and find #Tomlin the inn keeper hastily packing.\n\t- She says #Phandalin is no longer safe\n\t- 3 nights' past there was an alarm that the slums were on fire during the night then they were set upon by unknown assailants that were goblins, humans, hobglobins, drow, etc.\n\t- She explains that there is an old abandoned outpost about half a day's hike away.\n\t- They heard a large eruption like an earthquake and the attacking army dispersed \n\t- I ask about the owners of the #spelunkin\n\t\t- Most of the survivors owe their lives to them and they are tending wounded at the outpost.\n\t- To reach the outpost take the road to the south past the giant's toe\n- I head to the giant's toe and investigate to see if maybe the army was searching for the hidden tunnel below the bar.\n\t- On the way, we notice that it looks like 5 of the dwarven statues are missing.\n\t- It seems like the ground has been disturbed and some scorch marks on the pedestals.\n\t- I pull out the dwarvish hammer and the inscription is glowing\n\t\t- Harkness relates that the symbols are ancient \n\t- The statues are the same as on the map that #Gundrin gave me\n\t\t- The map shows the order that orbs should be placed on the statue in order to open up a vault below.\n\t- We check out the miner's guild\n\t\t- We find some documents showing the loss (in deaths) that's acceptable for different mines/profit expectations\n\t\t- Talia Thornton is the president of this regions guild\n\t\t- We find 3 safes. 1 is person sized and the other 2 are about half the size\n\t\t\t- I cast identify. The large safe is warded with a fire-ball spell\n\t\t\t- 1'st small safe is stacks of documents all written in code that we can't understand.\n\t\t\t- 2nd small safe is filled with gold and gems\n\t\t\t\t- 190 gold and 600 silver\n\t\t\t\t- Some gems\n\t\t\t- Fiona got stabbed twice trying to loot the desk in the room.\n\t\t\t- We eventually get the door to open. trip the fireball spell which sets off explosives in the safe\n\t- We check out the giant's toe. we infer that maybe \n\t- We are missing puss\n\t\t- Last time we saw puss was when we were studying the statues. so I go back to search for him there.\nI don't find Puss at the status so I go check out the well and find Puss on a rope checking out the bottom of the well.\n- Puss explains what he was doing\n\t- He was scoping it out, and he found a group of 6 hobgloblins, goblins, and drows guarding an entrance to some caves\n- We had back to the inn and take a #long_rest . We then decide to head back to the well and explore the caves\n# Hidden tunnels at the bottom of the well\n- We all take the rope and work our way down the well\n- we drop the goat into the water\n\t- the goat, and harkness are starting to drown\n\t- I slide now and pull them out\n- we finally get everyone down and into the ledge\nWe see two goblins who are surprised by what they just saw. We see an alarm bell past them\n\t- We surprise enough that we end up bluffing our way past the goblins.\n\t- There is a door that we proceed through\n- We see an image of the dwarves constructed a weapon like this below to beat the dragons\nWe find some machinery. We get it working. It makes a lot of noise. Some guards start coming\n- 8 guards come walking in. They are dressed a little like the patrons of the giants toe when we first met #Marys but they now have chain mail armour on over their tunics\n\t- I recognize some of them from the bar\n- We try to convince them we are fixing the machinery for Marys\n\t- all but one are convinced\n\t- We get some of them to start helping clear out the machinery\n\t- I show them my contract. \n\t- We convince them to finish clearing out the rubble and say we'll report the results to #Marys \n\t- One of the guards is convinced so well that he offers to get us a drink for the help. \n- We follow the guard for a drink. When we got the machinery running, it also turned on some lights\n- We come to the bar. There are about 60 guards in the room.\n- We grab a table and get a drink with the guard who is named Hemon Cenacchi\n- We catch some chatter about the recent activities\n\t- They were part of the army that sacked kragma and the town\n- There are 3 exits including the one we came in.\n\t- 1 looks like there's a spot for bedrolls\n\t- 1 is guarded by some drow\nA fight breaks out in the bar\n- We get the drow guards involved in the fight then sneak through the door\n- We come across two traps\n\t- At the second trap which is a fire trap Fiona gets caught\n- We eventually come to a door that's slightly ajar\n\t- There is a large room with a figure cloaked in a dark robe standing in front of a bust that looks like dwarven weapon we saw an image of\n\t- We also see 6 dwarven statues leading up to the final platform where the figure is\n- Aeyr and I open the door stealthily \n\t- Puss casts pass without a trace\n\t- We enter the room\n# Final Battle with Marys\nWe enter a room and see a figure standing in front of a bust of a dwarven mech\n\t- Fiona and I use dimension door and teleport next to the figure and attack\n\t- It turns out it was an illusion and Marys steps out\n\t- She asks if we want to join her but we decide against it and attack instead\n- Two more drow are hiding in an alcove\n- I cast message and mock the drow concentrating on force wall causing them to lose concentration\n- Marys throws some orbs into the air causing the 4 statues to come to life then misty steps away\n\nstarting out I am on the right side attacking the drow. \n- My spyder familiar feels like #Marys might be in another alcove on the left side. However, It looks like a simple wall to me when I look\n- I attack the drow and take out one of them\n- On the right side is are 2 alcoves\n- Fiona launches magic missile, 2 bolts to the top left alcove and 1 bolt to the bottom left alcove\n\t- He hits her in the top alcove and she drops the illusion hiding the left alcoves\n- sickle\n\t- cast 1 per long rest\n\t\t- 3d10 damage 10 ft radius around me\n\t\t- blinded within 30 ft for 3 rounds\n\t\t- plants also grow to 5 times the size\n\t- can use a 2nd time but it causes me half damage\n\t- use as ordinary weapon\n- I take off towards Mary's to hit her with the sickle 2nd attack\n- Harkness rides past and I hop onto the back of her and her goat as she rides past\n- Mary's slaps her hand and disappears. In the process she releases a thunder damage hurting us close to her \nMary's Does her disappearing act\n- 2 of the statues start moving slowly towards the stairs\n- I jump off the goat and head towards the statues\n- There are 4 orbs in the vonandod \n\t- These are the dwarven orbs that Marys was hunting down\n\t- I steal one using mage hand\n- I cast identify on one of the statues\n\t- whatever was in the orbs went into them when it was smashed against them and that's what is controlling. These are the same type of spirit orbs that when we smashed caused the skeletons to come to life and attacked everything around them\n\t- They are being controlled remotely if that stops they will stop immediately\n\t- their vulnerability is acid\n\t- immune to lighting and poison \n- 2 of the statues are destroyed\n- puss steals the rest of the orbs in the vonandod \n- I concentrate on attacking the 2 statues left until everyone gets to me\n- A group of knights of the void show up.\n\t- I convince them that the statues attacked marys and we are trying to fight them off\n\t- the group believes me and moves to attack the statutes\n\t- In the process I convince some of them to toss me some healing potions\n- I get half the knights of the void to attack the statue and half to search for a hidden passage because I convince them it is weird that the statues came back to life\n- I get 6 potions from the group. For every 3 I take I have to make a con save and if I fail a 10 I am drunk (disadvantage on attacks) for 1 hour\n\t- I drink 2 of them\n- puss is getting drawn back to the vonandod and puts the orbs back in then yells to fiona that he needs the last orb.\n- After he yells that, Marys steps out of the statue thinking that someone has the 4th orb. she still hasn't realized we have the 5th orb\n- I yell to the KofV group and convince them that Marys stepping out of the statue is an imposter stepping out of a hidden tunnel and rally them behind me as I charge towards Marys \nI get close to Marys and use the sickle to kill marys\n- We convince the #knights_of_the_void  that Fiona is the new boss\n- We take the 4th  and 5th orb and put it in the vonadod\n- A massive amount of energy comes out of it and blows a hole through the ceiling\n- We loot marys\n\t- whip\n\t- a necklace with a claw holding an orb\n\t- I cast identify on the necklace and there is a spirit trapped inside of it that was put their by magical sacrifice\n- We worry that the spirit in the necklace might be Marys, but we need to figure out if that's true and if so how to deal with it. The last time we broke an orb it released a spirit that possessed something and attacked us.\n- As we are leaving we see a side tunnel with what looks like tracks from the rest of the KoV.\n\t- I send the spyder down the tunnel and it sees that the army is clearing out with only the KoV left. They are all gathered around and heading up  staircase\n- We go through the tunnel and come out right at #14. We notice buildings #13 and #3 are falling into the hole caused by the blast\n- We head to the Inn and take a #long_rest we notice a for sale sign on the Inn\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.525455712Z","tags":null},"/DnD/Sessions_Ep02/049-202407016-Post_Campaign":{"title":"049-20240703-Post_Campaign","content":"\n## Session Summary\n\n## Recap of Last Session\n\n## Log\n\n- After a long rest we come down and find #Cyrus who was the assistant of Mary's\n\t- He want's to talk to us about some important business and has some breakfast ready for us\n\t- We say if he can help us get the dead transfered to us from the KoV bar we'll hire him\n- We then head back to the island to see if we can pick up Sorin Winterhill as a brewer for our new Inn\n- The beach/island looks a little worse for wear. We come to the \"bloody beach\" and we see bodies in the water and on the beach and door busted in at the \"bloody beach\" inn.\n\t- Leading up to the tavern we see 12 bodies, some cut some have their necks broken\n\t- some of the \"pirates\" have a small crimson band on their wrist\n\t\t- They all have the same fish on it\n- I head into the tavern and find 6 more bodies.

Meanwhile the chef, who I ask their name again and learn is #sashenstar , makes some more soup for dinner. I have some although some of the others are hesistant\n\nIt's getting late when we hear a knock at the door. Fiona knocks back on the door which confuses the person. Fiona then makes a knock knock joke. The person at the door is a pretty rough looking human male with a missing eye, and missing hand. \n- He introduces himself as #razortooth_mike and says he thinks we sent for him\n- he comes in and has some of the soup. He seems friendly and warms up to us pretty quickly\n- when he sees me he comes up and swears a blood oath to me sayeing I saved his family and friends. It turns out his family are miners and he accredits their saving to me\n- I cut my own hand and grasp his cut hand with mine than tell him to just act normal around us\n#razortooth_mike goes back to his soup than asks where are we sailing too. \n\t- We ask if there is anything due west. He says nothing that he knows about due west. Some stuff southwest and some northwest.\n\t- we ask about the pirate colors and symbols on the pirates. Unfortunately he says the pirates change so much he doesn't recognize these particular ones and can't tell if they are just new pirates or old pirates that have changed.\n\t- I explain what we know about #sorin and my vision. He's not sure and doesn't have any specific suggestions for us, but he's willing to sail due west to the end of the world for us.\n- Razortooth mike inspects the ship. Says we have about 5 days of rations and water which would get us just past #the_purple_rocks. \n\t- I ask about the purple rocks. He said he would rather not utter anything and anger #umberly . He says they she has a lot of followers on the purple rocks. He would rather not sail there but if you ask I will. We just might not return from there.\n\t\t- I know that #umberly is the sea goddess. There is a lot of superstition about not uttering her name on the open seas.\n\t- I ask if the pirate banner from the dead priates could be related to this group\n\t\t- It's not uncommon for people like them to hire pirate groups for supplies or for other reasons.\n- He gives us more info of the surrounding areas\n\t- #gunderlan is where is from and it's to the northwest. It's home to the best fisherman, boatmakers, sailors, They have lots of wharehouses and do lots of traiding. The capital city is #gundbarg . A lot of miners live there.

I need to pull data out of either a database or excel file.\nproject Lemhi (L)\n- had to clean up different generations of data from different sources (excel files, databases, text files)\n\t- some data needed to get help finding the correct metadata\n\t\t- was the assay in oz/t or g/t?\n\t- some used common sense.\n\t\t- -90 drill angle versus 90. \n\t\t\t- had to flip some drill angle recordings\n\t- managed a group of people who did some manual checks\n\t\t- evaluated the option of using machine learning to parse pdf's but determined we didn't have the time to implement\n- Task was analyzing the data and talking to people who knew more about the data to figure out all of the metadata needed to actually use the data properly\nresult \n\ta clean database that we have used going forward with all releavant and available metadata inserted.\n\n\n# Q5 Evaluate and Improve stuff\nDescribe two examples of how you evaluated and improved a data product or a software application.\n1) DHDB Repo\n- Situation\n\t-  Exploration companies often store their drill hole databases, that eventuially get used for mineral resource estimates, in unique and varried ways. Cleaning this up, standardizing the metadata etc, and checking for common input errors is often time consuming and a pretty manual task\n- Task\n\t- I have been working for a while on taking tools available in python to create a semi-automated dhdb cleanup and checking tool\n- Actions\n\t- This is a complicated process, so I have been working on this off and on for a while. I started very simply with just some easy checks and standardizations.\n\t\t- renaming column names to standardized names\n\t\t- standardize information in each table\n\t\t- check for missing data\n\t\t\t- insert missing data if available from other tables \n\t\t- check for duplicate data \n\t\t- export any errors to an excel file that we can use to go back and the check logs with\n\t- Over time, every other project I'll evaluate the tool and add a little bit here and there\n\t\t- check for overlapping intervals\n\t\t- create a \"best assay\" column when multiple assay methods are used\n\t\t- fill in missing intervals with a no-data value (this can be just as important as a present value)\n- Results\n\t- The cleanup and standardizing of dhdb data for a Mineral resource estimate has spead up a lot for us. I don't have hard numbers, but it is easily 3-4 times faster for me to clean up data now (depending on the number of errors I come across)\n\n1) \n\n# Q6 FAIR and Showings Database\n\nF\nappears to have rich meta data\nmetadata includes explicity identifier\ndata is registerd and indexed in a somewhat serchable way.

I left Newmont and completed a M.Sc. at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB, CA) where I studied geospatial analysis at the [Centre for Computational Geostatistics](http://www.ccgalberta.com/) My research and post-graduate work has focused on my interest in understanding and using uncertainty in a geospatial analysis framework. In addition to my research, I worked with three other members of the research group to develop the python package [PyGeostat](http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/welcome.html) to manage geostatistical workflows and to provide data visualization for geostatistics in a python environment.\n\n## Geospatial Analysis\n\nWorking at the University of Alberta in the [Centre for Computational Geostatistics](http://www.ccgalberta.com/) provided me with an amazing opportunity to gain a practical and theoretical background in geospatial analysis. There are many exciting areas of research that are taking place in the CCG, all with expanding our knowledge on how to deal with spatial modeling of multiple variables to correctly account for and manage the uncertainty that is inherent in geologic data.\n\n## Programming\n\nAs a self-taught programmer, my experience has been in developing within Python and Fortran. Most of my Python experience comes from developing (jointly with primarily 3 other student researchers) the geostatistical package [PyGeostat](http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/welcome.html). Fortran gets me a lot of raised eyebrows. Yes fortran is still used today! albeit barely and almost exclusively in a academic/scientific programming setting. My thesis was based around developing an algorithm in Fortran for optimizing concurrently over many models to take into account uncertainty, all within the Mining/Geostatistical/Decision Making frameworks. I have since continued learning as a hobbyist to further expand my knowledge in programming and development. Some of my public repositories are viewable on [github](https://github.com/tyleracorn/)\n\n## Engineering\n\nAs an Engineer with over 6 years of experience in the day to day operations of a major gold mine I developed myself both technically and as a leader. I am technically strong enough to help push projects through, yet with my calm and friendly nature I bring groups together into a well-rounded team to ensure goals are set and either achieved or exceeded.\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.527455724Z","tags":null},"/journey":{"title":"Journey","content":"Listing of my github projects.\n\n\n## Yeg Census Neighbourhoods\n[yeg_census_neighbourhoods](portfolio/yeg_census_neighbourhoods.md) is a project where I looke at the 2016 census data for Edmonton neighborhoods to try to glean insights into the economic distribution of YEG residents.

Only one prediction architect is currently implemented.\n\n### Prediction Weighting Schema\n\nCurrently this package uses a pseudo variogram style weighting schema with the following model (for location *i* and as an example 2 distances)\n\n.. image:: CodeCogsEqn.gif\n![variogram equation](https://github.com/tyleracorn/prospectPredictor/raw/master/CodeCogsEqn.gif \"variogram equation\")\n\n### Generating a prospectivity heat map\n\nUsing the package you can generate a heat map with liklihood of finding the element (based on a distance from 2 or more shape categories). The predictor generates prediction values ranging from 0, being least likely (i.e. 0%), to 1, being most likely (i.e. 100%). As an example here is a heat map generated from the included dataset.\n\n![Prediction Heat Map](assets/images/predictionHeatMap_projectBoundary.png \"Prediction Heat Map\")\n\n### Example\n\nAn example.ipynb is included in the repo to demostate how to use the package.\n\n### Dataset\nthe included dataset is from the `British Columbia Geological Survey \u003chttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/british-columbia-geological-survey\u003e`.\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.527455724Z","tags":null},"/portfolio/pygeostat":{"title":"pygeostat","content":"pygeostat is a Python 3.6 module for geostatistical modeling. pygeostat is aimed at preparing spatial data, scripting geostatistical workflows, modeling using tools developed at the Centre for Computational Geostatistics, and constructing visualizations to communicate spatial data.\n\n## Features:\n\n* Configurations of persistent project parameters and plotting style parameters\n* Data file management functions for interacting with CSV, GeoEAS (GSLIB), and VTK formats\n* Utilities for managing GSLIB-style grid definitions\n* Export gridded and point data files for visualization with Paraview (VTK format)\n* Simplified scripting of gslib programs with parallelization and crash detection/notification\n* Linear desurveying and compositing methods including automatic composite detection\n* Fast, accurate variogram calculation, model fitting and modeling routines\n* Vast library of plotting functions\n\nIf you are interested for now you can head over to the [pygeostat homepage](http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/).

However, as with any data visualization project, I had to learn about the data itself and make some assumptions. So first here are the map \"goals\"\n\n* does a neighbourhood have a larger percentage of low income households or a larger percentage of middle class households\n* what is the distribution for each neighbourhood of low income, middle class, and high income households\n\nThe first major assumption made in preparing the data for visualization was what categorizes a household as either \"low income\", \"middle class\", or \"high income\". To be considered middle class it seems like you need to make above the median income for your area [\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/money-economy/are-you-in-the-middle-class/). In Edmonton that equates to an income of $70,080 (before tax) or $61,330 (after tax)[\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110001501\u0026pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.35). A better and more detailed analyses is by using the [Low Income Measure After Tax](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75f0002m/75f0002m2018002-eng.htm). However the census data source I am using for this basic project doesn't include enough data to calculate the LIM-AT. So for this project the $60K is the entry point into the \"middle class\" category. That is based on the income categories available in the data source.\n\nThe upper range of middle class is less well defined. Looking at the household income for all of Edmonton we can see the following breakdown of values\n\n* Less than $30K (16.1%)\n* Less than $60K (40.9%)\n* Less than $100K (66.7%)\n* Less than $125K (78.7%)\n* Less than $150K (86.3%)\n* Less than $200K (93.7%)\n* Less than $250K (96.8%)\n* More than $250K (3.8%)\n\nFor the purpose of this project the \"high income\" is meant to show the top 20% of the households by income which equates to the $150K break point.\n\n## Code Features and Improvements\n\n### Neighbourhood Selection Option\n\n- [x] use dc.selectionMenue to select a neighbourhood to highlight\n- [ ] remove the default \"select all\" option since that doesn't make sense with this type of data\n\n### Pie Chart showing the breakdown of Household income brackets\n\n- [x] show the percentage of households in each income bracket\n- [x] mouseover shows the bracket and percentage\n- [x] format the values in the legend and mouseover to show percentage instead of the decimal format the data is saved as\n- [x] format the income bracket name.

If you are like me and are a self taught programmer/coder/data scientist... you are probably pretty comfortable with loops. We all know that loops are \"horribly slow\" and that you \"should never use\" them... blah blah blah.... However, for many of us, they are our default approach for a quick and dirt \"first draft.\" What I want to talk about in this post are hashtables.\n\n## Hash tables\n\nSo what are hash tables? They are an unorderd collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique. In python, think of a dictionary, or you could think of a one-dimensional array where your key is the index, but you are not constrained to an integer based index.\n\nIf have done any programming in python, you probably know about the dictionary. But have you considered using it like an array? Lets look at an example. I'll code it up the \"quick and dirty loop-de-loop\" way and then compare it to using a hash table.\n\n## Example\n\nHere's the example. Write up a function that takes as input two arguments. Arg1 is a list (or 1D array) of integers. Arg2 is a single integer. If any two separate values in your list add up to equal the Arg2 integer, return True. Otherwise return False.\n\nfirst we'll look at the quick and dirty approach.\n\n```python\ndef compare_int_long(intList, testInt):\n    \"\"\"\n    compare a list of integers to a single integer.\n\n    return true if any 2 integers (i1 + i2) == testInt\n    false otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    for idx1 in range(len(intList)):        # loop through the list\n        int1 = intList[idx1]                # grab current integer\n        for idx2 in range(len(intList)):    # loop through the list again\n            if idx2 != idx1:\n                int2 = intList[idx2]        # compare to every other integer\n                if int1 + int2 == testInt:\n                    return True             # passed test, so return true\n    return False                            # failed so return false\n```\n\nThis approach works, but is very brute force. For every element in your list, you compare it to every other element in your list to see if it passes the test. The problem with this approach? It scales pretty bad. This, I believe, is an *O(N\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)* complex code. This means the performance of this function increases proportionally to the square of the size of the input list.\n\nNow lets look at an example where we use the hash table (or a dictionary in python). first off though, there are a few things to note. If you create a standard dictionary in python and you call it with an undefined key... you'll raise an error. For example\n\n```python\ntemp_dict = {'a': 1, 'b':2}\ntemp_dict['c']  # raises an error\n```\n\nDefaultdict, however has an interesting property. If you pass it a key with no value, it will assign a default value to that key. So with the above example we can modify it:\n\n```python\ntemp_dict = defaultdict({'a': 1, 'b':2}, bool)\ntemp_dict['c']  # returns False\n```\n\ndefaultdict makes the above problem much easier to tackle. You could set up a try block to catch any raised errors... or use default dict as shown here.\n\nThe other thing to note, is that we need to rethink how we structure the problem. Instead of comparing each integer to every other integer (which is an *O(N\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e)* performance problem), we consider a different approach. Our first test was `int1 + int2 == testInt`. However, we can rearrange the problem to `int2 == testInt - int1`. This is important because this allows us to do two separate loops through the list instead of a nested loop. Let's look at the example.\n\n```python\ndef compare_int_hash(intList, testInt):\n    \"\"\"\n    compare a list of integers to a single integer.\n\n    return true if any 2 integers (i1 + i2) == testInt\n    false otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    intHash = defaultdict(bool)             # default value will be False\n    intCount = defaultdict(int)             # default value will be 0 which is usefull for counting\n    listLength = len(intList)\n\n    for idx in range(listLength):           # 1st loop creating a hash table with the key being testInt - int1 and the value being True\n        val = testInt - intList[idx]\n        intHash[val] = True\n        intCount[val] += 1                  # count how many times\n    for idx in range(listLength):           # 2nd loop seeing if int2 is found in the hashtable\n        if intHash[intList[idx]]:\n            if intCount[intList[idx]] \u003e 1:  # do a quick check against the count so we know if we there are 2 values or if we just happen to have a single value that's half the testInt\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\nThe above example is probably more like a *O(2N)* scale problem. So, now lets take a quick look at the performance of these two functions.\n\n![Loopy-De-Loop vs Hashing](web_posts/images/loop_vs_hash.png)\n\nAs you can see, the loopy-de-loop version very very quickly scales out of control. With just a list of 10,000 elements, worst case scenario, it'll take you roughly 53 seconds to test. However by using the hash table with the value you are wanting as the index key, you can test that same 10,000 element list in under a second (~0.01 s). Now just because it's dramatically different doesn't mean it's not scaling. There is an issue of scale here.\n\n![Hash scale](web_posts/images/hash_scale.png)\n\nYou can see that the hash table approach is still scaling. It's just more more of a linear increase instead of the exponential scaling of the nested loop.\n\nIf you want to play around with the above code, you can check out an example notebook here: [Ex_hashtables.ipynb](https://github.com/tyleracorn/lessons/blob/master/Ex_Hashtables.ipynb)\n\nOr, open up my lessons repo on my binder and navigate to the `Ex_hashtables.ipynb` file in myBinder's interactive environment\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tyleracorn/lessons/master)\n\nHope you enjoyed this quick example!\n\n## Further Resources\n\nIf you want some further resources or even just have things explained another way, here are a few resources I found useful.\n\n* Algorithms online textbook.

I find a lot of people new to data science, geostatistics, etc. are usually familiar and comfortable with histograms, however there is a lot to learn from CDF's which is why I tend to rely on them more. This series will cover the following topics\n\n1. What are they?\n    - Explain what a Histogram and CDF is\n    - Show what info we can easily read from each graph type\n\n2. When should we use them?\n    - What are the pro's and con's of these graphical representations.\n\n## TL:DR\n\nAt their heart, both the histogram and the CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) are displaying similar information, but in different ways. A histogram can be thought of as an empirical estimation of the Probability Density Function (PDF) and represents the probability with areas. Technically the PDF would represent this with an \"area under the curve\". Histograms are bar plots... so I guess we can say they represent this with the area of a bar! The CDF represents probability with vertical distances and is cumulative.\n\n### Note: Example Data\n\nThe main plots for this post are all based on the same randomly generated distribution of numbers created using Numpy's random number generator in Python. To keep it to something most people are familiar with, the distribution is based on a normal distribution. I'm using a small number of data so my distribution is not \"perfect\" but much more realistic. If you want to see how I do this you can check out my example notebook [ex_histograms_and_cdfs](https://github.com/tyleracorn/lessons/blob/master/Ex_histograms_and_CDFs.ipynb) which shows all of the plots used in this post.\n\n## What's a Histogram\n\nHistograms are one commonly used graphical representation of a distribution of numbers. They are typically plotted in a bar graph style plot where the height of each bar shows the frequency of a bin and represents the probability that a number will fall within that bin. This is in essence a slice of the area under a curve. The width of the bar represents the bin size used to group the numbers (or the width of the slice). The total width of all bars shows the range of values in the distribution. Here's an example showing the histogram and the estimated PDF for my normal distribution:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/quartz/notes/images/2020/normal_histogram_pdf.png\" style=\"max-width:300px\" width=\"100%\" alt='histogram_pdf'\u003e\n\nAs a quick side note: Many histogram plotting functions/programs out there by default plot a histogram with 'Frequency' on the y-axis. I don't find this vary useful because the frequency doesn't really mean anything without also knowing the how many samples are in your distribution. If you have a count of 30 samples in a bin and your sample size is 50 then that means something totally different than if you have a sample size of 10,000. Using the 'Density' option in numpy/matplotlib/plotly or whatever program you are using will convert it over to a probability value which I find way more useful. Here's a quick example showing the density plot versus the frequency plot.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/quartz/notes/images/2020/normal_histogram_density_compare.png\" style=\"max-width:600px\" width=\"100%\" alt='histogram_density_vs_frequency'\u003e\n\n## What's a CDF\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (aka. CDF) is another graphical representation of the distribution of numbers (discrete, or continuous). The y-axis represents the cumulative probability, aka the percentile of your distribution. The x-axis is the values in your distribution (ordered from least to greatest). The line is using vertical distances to show the probabilities. Here's an example of the same normal distribution.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/quartz//notes/images/2020/normal_cdf.png\" style=\"max-width:300px\" width=\"100%\" alt='cdf'\u003e\n\nThe CDF also works quite well for categorical distributions. Just be mindful of how the categories are related (ordinal or nominal). Here's an example of the same normal distribution converted into a categorical distribution by converting all values to integers:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/quartz//notes/images/2020/normal_int_cdf.png\" style=\"max-width:300px\" width=\"100%\" alt='categorical cdf'\u003e\n\n## How do we read a Histograms\n\nOk so you probably already knew what a histogram was, and you might already know how to read a histogram, but to make sure we are on the same page lets look at what the histogram shows us. We'll take the same normal distribution and plot it's histogram, but this time in an interactive plot so you can look at some of the values yourself.\n\n{% include posts_images/2020/2020-04-normal_histogram_pdf.html %}\n\nFirst there are a some general pieces of information we can see from the plot without plotting any annotation. These are the range of values, probability of a value within a bin, the general shape of the distribution, the skewness of the distribution, and possible outliers. So lets look at those with the above plot:\n\n| Range of values | 6.39 to 22.42 |\n| Probability of value in 4th bin | ~6% |\n| Shape of the distribution | Typical normal \"bell curve\" |\n| Skewness | None |\n| Outliers | None |\n\nIn the above table, we did say there wasn't any skewness. How do we know that? Well some of it is based on our own loosy-goosy feeling of what the shape looks like. The other way we can get a quick sense is to also plot the mean and median lines and see if they \"look\" close together. Which brings up another interesting point. You can't really tell what the mean or median of your distribution is without plotting them. It's a non-trivial probablem to add up in our heads the probabilities of all the different bins and figure out which bin lies in the middle. Here it might look easy because we are dealing with a normal distribution. In Part 2, we'll look at a bunch of different distributions, such as the log normal distribution, and you can see how hard it is to actually tell intuitively where your median value is.\n\n## How do we read a CDF's\n\nNow that we know what a CDF is, lets start looking at what sort of information one can glean from this graph. This time we'll plot up the CDF in an interactive plot. So go ahead and play around with it some!\n\n{% include posts_images/2020/2020-04-normal_cdf.html %}\n\nWhat are the general pieces of information we can see? The range of values, Percentiles (i.e. P20 is where 20% of the values are less than or equal to that value), Your median (because the median is the P50), anything related to the percentiles (i.e. what values are between the P20 and the P80, or what values lie within +/- 20% of the median). So looking at the above cdf to find the percentile we find the decimal percentile value on the Y axis (P20 = 0.2) drew a line horizontally over to our cdf line and then go straight down, that's the percentile of our distribution. So let's look at some of those values for the above plot:\n\n| P20 | 11.6 |\n| Median (P50) | 14.4 |\n| Values between P20 - P80 | 11.6 to 17.2 |\n| Probability of values between 11.6 and 17.2 | 80% - 20% = 60% |\n\nWhat about the slope of the line? The slope of the line along the CDF also gives us some basic information. This in affect tells us how spread out values are. A steeper slope means that the there is less spread and a shallower slope gives shows a greater relative spread in your data. So if we have a relatively shallow slope at the top or bottom that could be an indication of possible outliers. Also if there is a relatively shallow slope somewhere in the middle of the distribution, that could be a sign of a bimodal distribution.\n\n## Summary\n\nHopefully you have a little bit better understanding of what Histogram's and CDF's can show you about your distribution. If you want to get a quick snapshot of your distribution to see what type of distribution you might be dealing with, a histogram is your best bet. But if you want to get a better grasp of the complexities of your distribution and what you are actually dealing with, I find myself flipping back and forth a lot between both the histogram and the CDF. Stay tuned for part 2 where I will show you a bit about some of the pros and cons of using both the histogram and CDF and why, even though I realy more heavily on the CDF myself, I so often find myself flipping back and forth between both of them.\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.529455735Z","tags":null},"/web_posts/2022-08-01-strength-reduction-knots":{"title":"Strength Reduction of Knots - Edelrid Test","content":"## Overview\n\nEdelrid has some interesting testing that they did on how knots reduce the strength of a rope/slings/cord. The tables were left in German so I decided to translate the table I was interested in and copy some of the highlights of the test over here. I do howerver, highly recommend going over and reading the [full article](https://edelrid.com/int-en/knowledge/knowledge-base/strength-reduction-of-textile-materials-by-knots) if your are interested.\n\n## Background on Why Knots Reduce Strength\nEssentially, a knot reduces the strength of textile materials due to the imbalanced distribution of the load on the fibers. The knot's bend radius is a key factor and is influenced by both the knot type and the direction of the load on the knot. The fibers in bent material are compressed, meaning that some are subject to less tension than others (see Figure 1). Tension peaks occur in the material, which can break at these points when subjected to a certain load. The cross-section shape (round, rectangular) and dimensions together with the material's elongation at break affect the impact of the uneven load distribution due to the knot. A highly stretchy material can compensate for these tension peaks more so than a static material as the fibers subject to the most tension stretch, placing the load on additional fibers.\n\n![Figure1 How Fibers break](web_posts/images/2022/ED_Blog-bild-1_knoten.jpg)\n_Figure 1: fibers subject to even tension in an unknotted rope; fibers subject to uneven tension at the knot's bend radius; these areas of peak tension are then the predetermined breaking point:_\n\n## Testing Parameters\nPrior to testing, all materials were conditioned in accordance with EN 892:2012, point 5.2. To this end, they were stored for 24 hours in conditions of 23 ± 2°C and 50% relative humidity.\n\n  \nThe tensile tests to obtain reference measurements with the unknotted materials were carried out at 300 mm/min. The elongation was measured visually. The knotted structures were implemented at 500 mm/min. All tensile tests were performed three times and the results were averaged. The standard deviation between the three values was between 0.2 kN and 1.8 kN.\n\nTo depict the reduction more clearly, in the case of knots on a single strand, the percentage reduction in strength was presented in comparison with the unknotted single strand. When subjected to the load, some knots did not tear but instead slipped until the loose end came through the knot. These values are marked with an *. In the case of Dyneema® in particular, knots start to slip quickly. Back-up protection to prevent complete slipping is therefore urgently required.\n  \nDuring the tests, many of the knots slipped until this was prevented. In the case of the offset overhand and double overhand bends, the slippage was stopped by a carabiner hung in the 'eyelet'. In the case of the belay station setups, it was stopped by the blown second anchor (in the case of the test, a knotted eight).\n\nIn the case of the Hardline, the sheath mainly tore and the Dyneema® core was pulled out of the knot.\n  \nIn the case of all materials with polyamide as the outer layer, the knot only slipped partially and, if it did, then one to three times in a jerky manner. The friction of the jerkily slipping knot melted the material to such a great extent that the knot stuck together and the fabric tore.\n\n## Discussion of the Results\n\nMajor differences were recorded in knot strength depending on the material and the type of knot. In the case of some materials or uses, the absolute strength values significantly exceed requirements, meaning it is ultimately irrelevant which knot is used and the decision can be taken based on practical usage aspects. With some combinations of material and usage, it makes sense to consider the strength reducing effect of a knot when making a selection.\n\n## Knots On A Single Strand\n\nKnots have the least strength reducing effect on ropes: a maximum of -43% with single strands. Knots have a particularly strong strength reducing effect on Aramid Cord (-64% on average across all knots), Hardline (-62% on average across all knots) and Dyneema® 8 mm (-54% on average across all knots). It is clear that with the remaining constructions, the presence of PA with greater elongation positively affects the strength reduction caused by knots.\n\n  \nWhen comparing knot types, the flat offset overhand and double flat overhand bends have the greatest strength reducing effect of -38% to -75%, with the offset overhand bend causing slightly greater strength reduction. The load type on the knot has a significant influence on the knot's strength reducing effect. If an offset overhand bend is subjected to load as a roping-up knot, the strength reduction is about 20% less than when the load is placed on the ring. The double fisherman's knot causes less strength reduction than the double flat overhand bend.\n\nThe Table below is an english translation of the Edelrid table.

Here's the results\n# Intro to Linear Algebra\n\nHello! Welcome to your learning path for understanding linear algebra. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations, matrices, vector spaces, and linear transformations. It is a fundamental subject that has applications in many fields, such as computer graphics, physics, engineering, economics, and statistics.\n\nTo start learning linear algebra, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Learn the basics of algebra: Before you dive into linear algebra, it's essential to have a good understanding of algebraic concepts like variables, equations, and operations. Make sure you have a solid foundation in algebra before proceeding.\n\n2. Study matrices: Matrices are a central concept in linear algebra. You'll need to understand how to add, subtract, multiply, and invert matrices. You'll also learn about determinants, which are useful for finding inverses and solving systems of linear equations.\n\n3. Understand vector spaces: A vector space is a set of vectors that satisfy certain properties. You'll need to know what a vector is and how to add and scale vectors. You'll also learn about linear combinations and linear independence.\n\n4. Study linear transformations: Linear transformations are functions that preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication. You'll learn how to represent them as matrices and how to find their kernels and ranges.\n\n5. Learn about eigenvectors and eigenvalues: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important in linear algebra because they help us understand how a matrix or linear transformation stretches or compresses vectors. You'll learn how to find them and how to use them to diagonalize matrices.\n\n6. Apply linear algebra: Once you have a good understanding of the basic concepts, you can start applying linear algebra to solve real-world problems. You can use linear algebra to solve systems of linear equations, find the least-squares solutions to over-determined systems, analyze networks, and more.\n\nI recommend using textbooks, online courses, or video lectures to learn linear algebra. Practice is essential, so make sure you work through lots of exercises and problems to solidify your understanding of the concepts. Good luck on your journey to understanding linear algebra!\n\n# Matrices\n\nMatrices are one of the fundamental concepts in linear algebra. They are rectangular arrays of numbers or variables that are arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are useful for representing and solving systems of linear equations, performing transformations, and many other applications in various fields of science and engineering.\n\nHere are some key concepts related to matrices that you should know:\n\n1. Matrix notation: A matrix is denoted by a capital letter, such as A or B, and its elements are denoted by a subscript notation, such as A[i,j] or B[m,n]. The size of a matrix is given by the number of rows and columns it has. For example, a matrix with m rows and n columns is said to be an m × n matrix.\n\n2. Types of matrices: Matrices can be classified based on their properties. Some common types of matrices are square matrices (when the number of rows and columns are equal), diagonal matrices (when all non-diagonal elements are zero), identity matrices (when all diagonal elements are one and all non-diagonal elements are zero), and symmetric matrices (when A = A^T, where A^T is the transpose of A).\n\n3. Operations on matrices: Matrices can be added, subtracted, and multiplied. Addition and subtraction are done element-wise, while matrix multiplication is done using a specific rule that involves dot products of rows and columns. You can also find the inverse of a square matrix, which is useful for solving systems of linear equations.\n\n4. Transpose: The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping it along its diagonal. The transpose of a matrix A is denoted as A^T. The transpose of a matrix can be used to define the dot product of vectors and to find the adjugate of a matrix.\n\n5. Determinant: The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar value that provides important information about the matrix. The determinant is used to determine whether a matrix has an inverse, to compute the inverse of a matrix, and to find the area or volume of a parallelogram or parallelepiped.\n\n6. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are used to describe the behavior of a matrix or linear transformation. Eigenvectors are vectors that remain in the same direction after a matrix or transformation is applied to them. Eigenvalues are scalars that represent how much an eigenvector is stretched or compressed by a matrix or transformation.\n\nUnderstanding matrices is essential to understanding linear algebra, and it forms the foundation for many advanced topics such as linear transformations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. By mastering matrices, you will be able to solve systems of linear equations, perform matrix transformations, and solve a wide range of problems in various fields.\n\n## Why Matrix Math?\n\nMatrix addition and multiplication are fundamental operations in linear algebra, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations, vector spaces, and linear transformations. Matrices provide a convenient way to represent and manipulate linear systems and transformations.\n\nHere are some reasons why matrix addition and multiplication are useful:\n\n1. Linear equations: Matrices are commonly used to represent systems of linear equations, which arise in many fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and computer science. Matrix addition and multiplication allow us to solve and manipulate these equations efficiently.\n\n2. Linear transformations: Matrices can also represent linear transformations, which are functions that preserve the properties of linear systems such as linearity, homogeneity, and superposition. Examples of linear transformations include rotations, reflections, scaling, and shearing. Matrix multiplication allows us to compose and apply these transformations efficiently.\n\n3. Data analysis: Matrices are widely used in data analysis and machine learning, where they represent datasets and operations such as feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Matrix addition and multiplication enable us to manipulate and transform these datasets efficiently.\n\n4. Graphics and computer graphics: Matrices are also used extensively in computer graphics and video game programming, where they represent transformations of 3D objects and camera views. Matrix multiplication allows us to apply these transformations to the vertices and pixels of these objects efficiently.\n\nOverall, matrix addition and multiplication are fundamental operations that are used extensively in many fields of science, engineering, and mathematics. They provide a powerful and versatile way to represent and manipulate linear systems and transformations, and are essential tools for solving problems and analyzing data.\n\n## Adding and Subtracting\n\nSure! Adding and subtracting matrices is a simple process that involves adding or subtracting corresponding elements in each matrix. Here are some examples:\n\nExample 1: Suppose we have two matrices A and B, given by:\n\n```\nA = [ 2  3 ]\n    [-1  4 ]\n\nB = [ 1 -2 ]\n    [ 3  0 ]\n```\n\nTo add these matrices, we simply add the corresponding elements in each matrix:\n\n```\nA + B = [ 2+1   3-2 ]\n        [-1+3   4+0 ]\n\n      = [ 3   1 ]\n        [ 2   4 ]\n```\n\nTo subtract these matrices, we simply subtract the corresponding elements in each matrix:\n\n```\nA - B = [ 2-1   3+2 ]\n        [-1-3   4-0 ]\n\n      = [ 1   5 ]\n        [-4   4 ]\n```\n\nExample 2: Suppose we have two matrices C and D, given by:\n\n```\nC = [ 1  2  3 ]\n    [ 4  5  6 ]\n\nD = [ 0  1  2 ]\n    [ 3  4  5 ]\n```\n\nTo add these matrices, we simply add the corresponding elements in each matrix:\n\n```\nC + D = [ 1+0   2+1   3+2 ]\n        [ 4+3   5+4   6+5 ]\n\n      = [ 1  3  5 ]\n        [ 7  9 11 ]\n```\n\nTo subtract these matrices, we simply subtract the corresponding elements in each matrix:\n\n```\nC - D = [ 1-0   2-1   3-2 ]\n        [ 4-3   5-4   6-5 ]\n\n      = [ 1  1  1 ]\n        [ 1  1  1 ]\n```\n\nIn general, when adding or subtracting matrices, make sure that the matrices have the same dimensions. That is, they must have the same number of rows and the same number of columns.\n\n### Matrix Addition using a real world example\n\nSure! Here is a real-world example of how matrix addition can be used:\n\nSuppose you are a store manager and you have a list of the daily sales for three products over the course of a week. You can represent this data as a matrix, where the rows correspond to the days of the week and the columns correspond to the products. Here is an example of what the matrix might look like:\n\n```\n    | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 |\n----|----------|----------|----------|\nMon |   100    |    75    |   120    |\nTue |    80    |   110    |    90    |\nWed |   120    |    90    |    80    |\nThu |    90    |   100    |   110    |\nFri |   110    |    80    |    70    |\nSat |    70    |   120    |   130    |\nSun |   100    |    90    |    60    |\n```\n\nNow, suppose you want to know the total sales for each day of the week. You can use matrix addition to compute the sum of each row, which gives you the total sales for each day. To do this, you simply add up the entries in each row and write the results in a new matrix. Here is the resulting matrix:\n\n```\n    | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 | Total Sales |\n----|----------|----------|----------|-------------|\nMon |   100    |    75    |   120    |     295     |\nTue |    80    |   110    |    90    |     280     |\nWed |   120    |    90    |    80    |     290     |\nThu |    90    |   100    |   110    |     300     |\nFri |   110    |    80    |    70    |     260     |\nSat |    70    |   120    |   130    |     320     |\nSun |   100    |    90    |    60    |     250     |\n```\n\nAs you can see, matrix addition allows you to combine the information from multiple matrices to obtain a new matrix that represents a summary of the data. In this case, we used matrix addition to compute the total sales for each day of the week, but matrix addition can be used for many other purposes as well.\n\n## Matrix multiplication\n\nCertainly! Multiplying matrices is a bit more involved than adding or subtracting matrices. The process involves taking dot products of the rows and columns of the matrices. Here are the steps for multiplying two matrices A and B:\n\n1. Check the dimensions: To multiply matrices A and B, the number of columns in A must be equal to the number of rows in B. If this condition is not satisfied, the matrices cannot be multiplied.\n\n2. Set up the product matrix: The product matrix C will have the same number of rows as A and the same number of columns as B. The elements of C will be computed as dot products of the rows of A and the columns of B.\n\n3. Compute the dot products: To compute the elements of C, take the dot product of each row of A with each column of B. The dot product of a row and a column is obtained by multiplying corresponding elements and summing the products. The dot product of row i of A and column j of B is given by:\n\n```\nC[i,j] = A[i,1]*B[1,j] + A[i,2]*B[2,j] + ... + A[i,n]*B[n,j]\n```\n\nwhere n is the number of columns in A and the number of rows in B.\n\n4. Repeat for all rows and columns: Compute the dot product for each pair of row and column indices and place the resulting value in the corresponding entry of the product matrix C.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate how to multiply matrices:\n\nExample: Suppose we have two matrices A and B, given by:\n\n```\nA = [ 2  3 ]\n    [-1  4 ]\n    [ 0  1 ]\n\nB = [ 1 -2  0 ]\n    [ 3  0  1 ]\n```\n\nTo multiply these matrices, we first check that the number of columns in A (2) is equal to the number of rows in B (2). Since this condition is satisfied, we can proceed with the multiplication.\n\nThe product matrix C will have 3 rows (the same as A) and 3 columns (the same as B):\n\n```\nC = [ *  *  * ]\n    [ *  *  * ]\n    [ *  *  * ]\n```\n\nTo compute the first element of C (the element in the first row and first column), we take the dot product of the first row of A and the first column of B:\n\n```\nC[1,1] = 2*1 + 3*3 = 11\n```\n\nTo compute the second element of C (the element in the first row and second column), we take the dot product of the first row of A and the second column of B:\n\n```\nC[1,2] = 2*(-2) + 3*0 = -4\n```\n\nWe repeat this process for all rows and columns:\n\n```\nC = [ 11 -4  6 ]\n    [-10  8 -1 ]\n    [  3  0  1 ]\n```\n\nSo the product of A and B is the matrix C:\n\n```\nA*B = [ 11 -4  6 ]\n      [-10  8 -1 ]\n      [  3  0  1 ]\n```\n\nThat's how you multiply matrices!\n\n### Real World Example\n\nCertainly! Here's an example of how matrix multiplication can be used in a real-world context:\n\nSuppose you are a sales manager for a company that sells three products in four regions. You want to calculate the total revenue generated by each product in each region. You have a matrix that represents the sales of each product in each region, and you have another matrix that represents the price of each product.\n\nHere is an example of what the sales matrix might look like:\n\n```\n    | Region 1 | Region 2 | Region 3 | Region 4 |\n----|----------|----------|----------|----------|\nProduct 1 |   100    |    75    |   120    |    90    |\nProduct 2 |    80    |   110    |    90    |   100    |\nProduct 3 |   120    |    90    |    80    |   110    |\n```\n\nAnd here is an example of what the price matrix might look like:\n\n```\n    | Product 1 | Product 2 | Product 3 |\n----|----------|----------|----------|\nPrice |    10    |    15    |    12    |\n```\n\nTo calculate the total revenue for each product in each region, you can use matrix multiplication. Specifically, you can multiply the sales matrix by the price matrix to obtain a new matrix that represents the revenue for each product in each region. Here is the resulting matrix:\n\n```\n    | Region 1 | Region 2 | Region 3 | Region 4 |\n----|----------|----------|----------|----------|\nProduct 1 |  1000    |   1125   |   1440   |   1080   |\nProduct 2 |  1200    |   1650   |   1350   |   1500   |\nProduct 3 |  1440    |   1350   |    960   |   1320   |\n```\n\nAs you can see, matrix multiplication allows you to combine information from two different matrices to obtain a new matrix that represents a summary of the data. In this case, we used matrix multiplication to calculate the total revenue for each product in each region, but matrix multiplication can be used for many other purposes as well.\n\n## Matrix Division\n\nMatrix division is not a well-defined operation like matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In fact, you cannot divide one matrix by another matrix directly. However, you can use matrix multiplication to solve systems of linear equations, which can be seen as a type of matrix division.\n\nSuppose we have a system of linear equations given by:\n\n```\na11*x1 + a12*x2 + ... + a1n*xn = b1\na21*x1 + a22*x2 + ... + a2n*xn = b2\n...\nam1*x1 + am2*x2 + ... + amn*xn = bm\n```\n\nWe can write this system in matrix form as:\n\n```\nA * x = b\n```\n\nwhere A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants. To solve for x, we can use matrix multiplication to isolate x:\n\n```\nA * x = b\nA^-1 * A * x = A^-1 * b\nx = A^-1 * b\n```\n\nwhere A^-1 is the inverse matrix of A. The inverse matrix A^-1 exists only if the determinant of A is not zero. If A is an n x n matrix, then its inverse matrix A^-1 is also an n x n matrix, and it is defined as:\n\n```\nA^-1 = 1/|A| * adj(A)\n```\n\nwhere |A| is the determinant of A, and adj(A) is the adjugate or classical adjoint of A, which is obtained by taking the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A.\n\nSo, to \"divide\" by a matrix, we actually need to find the inverse of the matrix, and then use matrix multiplication to solve a system of linear equations.\n\n## What are Determinants?\n\nIn linear algebra, the determinant is a scalar value that can be associated with a square matrix. The determinant provides information about the properties of the matrix, such as its invertibility, eigenvalues, and volume scaling factor.\n\nTo calculate the determinant of a square matrix A, we use the following formula:\n\n|A| = sum over all permutations of {1, 2, ..., n} of (sgn(p) * a1p1 * a2p2 * ... * anpn)\n\nwhere n is the size of the matrix (i.e., the number of rows/columns), p is a permutation of the indices {1, 2, ..., n}, sgn(p) is the sign of the permutation (+1 for even permutations, -1 for odd permutations), and aipj is the entry of the matrix in row i and column j.\n\nIn other words, to calculate the determinant of a matrix A, we take the sum of the products of the entries of A, each weighted by the sign of the corresponding permutation of the indices. This may sound complicated, but it becomes simpler for small matrices.\n\nFor example, consider the following 2x2 matrix A:\n\n```\na11 a12\na21 a22\n```\n\nThe determinant of A is:\n\n|A| = a11*a22 - a12*a21\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix A, the determinant is:\n\n|A| = a11*a22*a33 + a12*a23*a31 + a13*a21*a32 - a31*a22*a13 - a32*a23*a11 - a33*a21*a12\n\nDeterminants have several important properties:\n\n1. The determinant of a matrix A is zero if and only if A is not invertible (i.e., the matrix is singular). In this case, the system of linear equations represented by A has either no solutions or infinitely many solutions.\n\n2. The determinant of a product of matrices is equal to the product of the determinants of the individual matrices: |AB| = |A| * |B|. This means that if either A or B has determinant zero, then AB also has determinant zero.\n\n3. The determinant of the transpose of a matrix A is equal to the determinant of A: |A| = |A^T|. This means that the determinant is invariant under transposition.\n\n4. Multiplying a row or column of a matrix A by a scalar c multiplies the determinant of A by c. This means that the determinant is a linear function of each row or column.\n\nOverall, the determinant is a powerful tool for analyzing the properties of square matrices and solving systems of linear equations. It has many applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.\n\n### Explanation for Invertible\n\nAn invertible matrix is a square matrix that has an inverse matrix. The inverse matrix of a square matrix A is denoted by A^(-1) and has the property that A * A^(-1) = A^(-1) * A = I, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nIn other words, if a matrix A is invertible, we can multiply it by its inverse matrix A^(-1) to get the identity matrix I. The inverse matrix can be seen as a \"reverse\" operation to the original matrix, and allows us to \"undo\" the effects of A.\n\nA matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero. This means that if the determinant of a matrix is zero, the matrix is not invertible and is said to be singular. In this case, the system of linear equations represented by the matrix has either no solutions or infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe inverse of a matrix can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/|A|) * adj(A)\n\nwhere |A| is the determinant of A, and adj(A) is the adjugate matrix of A, which is obtained by taking the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A.\n\nThe inverse matrix is useful in many applications, such as solving systems of linear equations, finding the solution to least-squares problems, and computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues of matrices. It is also used in computer graphics and video game programming, where it is used to transform objects and camera views.\n\nOverall, invertible matrices are important in linear algebra and have many practical applications. The invertibility of a matrix is closely related to its determinant, and understanding the properties of these matrices is essential for solving problems in linear algebra and related fields.\n\n\n### Explanation for Invariant\n\nSure! In mathematics, an invariant is a property or quantity of an object that does not change under certain transformations or operations. In other words, an invariant is something that remains the same even after a change or transformation has been applied.\n\nFor example, the determinant of a matrix is an invariant under transposition. This means that if we take the transpose of a matrix, the determinant of the resulting matrix is the same as the determinant of the original matrix. Similarly, the eigenvalues of a matrix are invariant under similarity transformations, which means that if we multiply a matrix by a nonsingular matrix, the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix are the same as the eigenvalues of the original matrix.\n\nInvariants are useful in many areas of mathematics and physics, because they allow us to simplify problems and classify objects based on their properties. For example, in algebraic geometry, the concept of an invariant is used to study the geometric properties of curves and surfaces. In physics, the concept of an invariant is used to describe the laws of nature that remain the same under different reference frames.\n\nOverall, invariants are an important concept in mathematics and science, because they allow us to identify and analyze properties that remain unchanged under different transformations or operations.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-05-04T03:43:47.529455735Z","tags":null},"/web_posts/2023-09-09-SkinFrameKayak_Notes":{"title":"2023-09-09-SkinFrameKayak_Notes","content":"Accessories:\n- The catamaran and sail both look interesting.
