It&rsquo;s darker than it should be.
* It&rsquo;s hazy and darker than normal. almost like a mist
* We proceed (investigating for traps). We finally come to a large room
* Upon Entry to the room
* We see two glowing eyes about 70 m away.
* As soon as we enter the chamber - the fog clears but the entrance is still kind of foggy
* We see that the two eyes are two sets of eyes are attached to two heads of a very detailed statue of a five-headed dragon.
* Fiona investigates the 1st of the four sarcophegaous. It&rsquo;s empty
* We investigate the 4 statues.
* A, B, C, D
* each one has liquid in a basin that looks like the same liquid as the pool
* the basin get progressively more full from A - D with D being full.
* basin A is above the alters head
* Basin D is about waste height (and is full)
* We go investigate the alter
* It&rsquo;s black ebony stone (can be dull and shiny at the same time)
* It doesn&rsquo;t reflect light
* We smell blood and it&rsquo;s stained
* On top to the right is a dagger and on the left is bowl filled with the same orbs as where in the sarcophegous.
* There are 8 orbs which are clear (whereas as the ones before were opaque)
* The dagger is light and is made out of bone. It resembles a tooth with a handle
*
* The 5 heads look similar but different colors
* the colors going from bowls to the Sarcophegous
* White, black, green, blue, red
* The two active heads are looking down at the alter.
* I pick up one orb and put it in basin A.
* It moves a little
* We turn the dragon heads to look at the alter. Their eyes glows and entrance we came in closes
* We set the basins to mid height while the eyes are lit
* One of the tiles behind the alter clicks. We push on it and it opens and there is a ladder heading down into thedark</p><ul><li>We enter the hidden passage behind the alter<ul><li>We can see a glow at the end of the tunnel</li><li>We get to the end and there is another ladder which we head up to another room</li></ul></li><li>In the next room we see a giant flame and a door, a hook on the wall with a cloak hanging on it<ul><li>nothing in the cloak.
